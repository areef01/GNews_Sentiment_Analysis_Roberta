-OneArabia

UN Secretary-General António Guterres has raised concerns about two pressing global issues: the climate crisis and the unchecked growth of artificial intelligence. He stressed that these challenges pose significant risks to humanity, urging immediate and collective action from both governments and private sectors. His remarks came during the 55th World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos.

Guterres acknowledged AI's vast potential but warned against its unregulated expansion. He highlighted the importance of international cooperation, referencing the Global Digital Compact adopted at the United Nations as a guide for responsible digital technology use. ""We must collaborate so that all countries and people benefit from AI’s promise and potential to support development and social and economic progress for all,"" he said.

The Secretary-General also urged private companies not to retreat from their climate commitments. He called on governments to fulfill their pledges by developing new, comprehensive national climate action plans this year. This call to action underscores the urgency of addressing environmental challenges through coordinated efforts.

In a separate address, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez advocated for reforming social media governance within the European Union. He emphasized the need to combat misinformation and cyber harassment by strengthening enforcement of the Digital Services Act. Additionally, he proposed expanding powers for the European Centre for Algorithmic Transparency.

President Félix-Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo of the Democratic Republic of Congo announced a significant environmental initiative at the meeting. The creation of the Kivu to Kinshasa Green Corridor Reserve will establish the world's largest tropical forest reserve, protecting over 550,000 square kilometres of forest in the Congo River Basin.

""This historic, unprecedented initiative will transform not only our natural landscapes, but also the livelihoods of millions of our citizens,"" he stated. The project aims to go beyond environmental preservation by fostering economic development in the region.

ASEAN's Future Prospects

Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim expressed optimism about ASEAN's future as he prepares to take on its chairmanship. He highlighted Malaysia's role in regional integration, particularly in green energy, which has contributed to its status as a high-tech manufacturing leader. ""The spirit of collaboration and esprit de corps between [ASEAN] leaders is unique,"" he noted.

The discussions at Davos underscored a shared commitment among global leaders to tackle pressing issues such as climate change, digital governance, and regional cooperation. These initiatives reflect a broader effort to address complex challenges through collaboration and innovation.

During a panel discussion at Bloomberg House on “From Soil to Silicon: How Advanced Technologies are Cultivating the Future of Sustainable Ag,” he outlined how 2025 will mark the first year AI truly revolutionizes agriculture – from lab to field.

The five key trends in AI identified by Syngenta are:

1. AI in R&D: Today, all research projects at Syngenta utilize machine learning models to identify novel active ingredients for synthetic and biological products.

2. AI in the Field: The introduction of AI-driven systems for reliably monitoring and predicting soil health, enabling high-resolution soil nutrient, texture, and carbon maps for growers.

3. AI in Farmers' Hands: GenAI-enabled digital tools act as agronomic advisors to help farmers determine optimal crop management practices.

4. AI in Pest Management: Precision agriculture and data-driven decision-making solutions supporting farmers by targeting crop protection products only to infested areas.

5. AI in Supply Chain Management: Demand forecasting, market prediction, and reducing overproduction and waste to optimize logistics and improve efficiency.

Rowe said: “AI and digital tools are revolutionizing farming and sustainable practices. Advanced monitoring systems integrate satellite imagery, drones, and soil maps for precise crop management. Predictive analytics, powered by AI and machine learning, provide farmers with actionable insights, transforming reactive practices into proactive strategies.”

According to a recent report by AgriTech Market Analysis, the global AgriTech market, valued at $24.19 billion in 2023, is expected to reach $54.17 billion by 2029. The global market for AI in agriculture is projected to grow from $1.7 billion in 2023 to $4.7 billion by 2028, underscoring the significant economic potential of these technologies. A WEF report estimates that digital agriculture could boost the agricultural GDP of low—and middle-income countries by $450 billion annually.

During the panel discussion with Suzanne DiBianca, Executive Vice President & Chief Impact Officer at Salesforce, both panelists emphasized the critical need for collaboration among policymakers, businesses, and other stakeholders to reduce financial and technical barriers for farmers adopting technology.

The speakers concluded that the synergy between digital technologies and sustainable farming empowers farmers to tackle climate change while improving productivity. By integrating regenerative practices with cutting-edge technology, the agricultural sector is paving the way for a resilient food system that benefits both people and the planet.

In the misty peaks of Cameron Highlands, Malaysia’s vegetable bowl is showing signs of strain.

Once a thriving agricultural hub producing a third of the nation’s vegetables, farmers are grappling with a complex web of challenges threatening their survival.

“Our harvests have dropped by 30-40 per cent recently,” reveals Chai Ee Mong, decades the secretary of the Cameron Highlands Vegetable Growers Association, painting a stark picture of the industry’s current state.

Speaking to TRP, he said the mathematics of farming here has become increasingly challenging.

With approximately 2,200 farmers operating in the highlands, many smallholders – those working on less than five acres – find themselves increasingly precarious.

Labour Costs Squeeze Margins as Policy Changes Bite

Even during low-price periods, farmers still have to pay for the Temporary Occupation License (TOL), Chai explains.

The cost structure is daunting: 30-40% goes to pesticides and fertilizers, and another 30-40% to workers’ wages, not counting depreciation and maintenance costs.

Recent policy changes have added to farmers’ burdens.

The minimum wage increase from RM1,500 to RM1,700 and proposals for EPF contributions for foreign workers have stretched operational costs further.

The financial implications are significant, with 2.5 million legal foreign workers in Malaysia.

As Import Barriers Fall, Highland Farmers Seek Alternatives

Removing import APs (Approval Permits) during former prime minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri’s tenure has intensified competition.

Imported cabbage from Indonesia, China, and Vietnam can enter the below RM2 per kg market, while local wholesale prices hover around RM2.50 per kg.

“It’s still profitable, but margins are thin,” Chai notes.

The situation has forced some Indonesian farmers to switch to coffee cultivation.

At the same time, in Cameron Highlands, some have turned to strawberry farming – only to face another challenge with declining tourist numbers.

Inside Malaysia’s Widening Farm-to-Table Gap

Malaysia’s vegetable demand-supply gap is concerning.

The country needs three 3 tonnes annually but produces only 2 million tonnes, necessitating imports worth RM6.7 billion.

In September 2024, severe winds damaged numerous rain shelters and greenhouse structures.

With limited land availability in Cameron Highlands, farmers are expanding to areas like Lojing, though options remain constrained.

Support Schemes Fall Short as Farmers Battle Price Swings

Current support mechanisms appear inadequate.

The diesel subsidy of RM200 is restricted to farmers with annual sales below RM300,000, effectively excluding many operators.

There are no subsidies for essential inputs like fertilizers and pesticides.

While there’s a pioneer status tax exemption for new farmlands, Chai describes it as “impractical for smallholders” due to complex procedures.

Market volatility adds another layer of uncertainty.

Celery prices have dramatically swung from less than RM1 to over RM20 per kg.

Similar fluctuations affect other produce, including onions, which vary from under RM1 to RM6 per kg.

Food Security at Crossroads: Cameron Highlands’ Uncertain Future

The future remains uncertain as Cameron Highlands continues to produce around 1,000 metric tonnes of vegetables daily during good weather conditions.

The combination of rising input costs, labour issues, climate challenges, and market competition poses existential questions for Malaysia’s highland farming community.

The situation raises crucial questions about food security and the sustainability of local agriculture.

As one of Malaysia’s key agricultural regions faces these multifaceted challenges, the need for more effective policy interventions and support mechanisms becomes increasingly apparent.

The transfer took effect on 21 January 2025, making ConocoPhillips Sabah Gas Ltd. the sole operator of the KBBC PSC. Previously, the KBBC PSC was operated by Kebabangan Petroleum Operating Company Sdn. Bhd. (KPOC), a joint operating company comprising PETRONAS Carigali Sdn. Bhd., Shell Energy Asia Limited, and ConocoPhillips Sabah Gas Ltd.

The transfer of the operatorship was witnessed by the Finance Minister of Sabah Datuk Seri Panglima Masidi Manjun, representing Chief Minister of Sabah Datuk Seri Panglima Haji Hajiji Haji Noor, alongside Senior Vice President of MPM Datuk Ir. Bacho Pilong (see photo).

PETRONAS transfers Kebabangan Cluster PSC operatorship to ConocoPhilips

Datuk Seri Panglima Haji Hajiji said, 'Sabah is rapidly emerging as a preferred destination for oil and gas investments, thanks to the strategic developments and partnerships championed by PETRONAS and its industry collaborators. These initiatives underscore the vast potential of Sabah’s resources and reinforce our commitment to driving economic growth and creating opportunities for our people. We look forward to further collaboration with PETRONAS in the best interest of Sabah.'

Datuk Ir. Bacho said, 'We thank the Sabah State Government for their support in fostering a conducive environment for oil and gas investments. This collaboration reflects our shared commitment to realising business growth and enhancing energy security. We are also pleased to welcome ConocoPhillips’ expanded role in Malaysia’s upstream sector, which underscores the continued confidence in the nation’s energy potential.'

With an export capacity up to 750 million standard cubic feet of gas per day (MMscfd), the continuation of the KBBC PSC until the end of 2050 and other commercial agreements have been structured to ensure future gas field developments remain economically attractive in supporting Sabah's energy security requirements.

PETRONAS remains steadfast in its commitment to ensure an optimal and sustainable supply of oil and gas for energy security, with MPM playing a key role in managing petroleum arrangements and providing stewardship for upstream petroleum activities in Malaysia.

The projected growth in Malaysia’s GDP of 4.5% to 5.5% for 2025, further digitalisation of the property industry, national infrastructural enhancements, and increased FDIs and DDIs are all considered contributing factors to the positive momentum in the property market for 2025.

KUALA LUMPUR (Jan 23): Malaysia’s property market saw an overall increase of 14% in transaction value to almost RM163 million and 6% in transaction volume to 311,211 units in the first nine months of 2024, in comparison to the same period in 2023.

Looking forward, the projected growth in Malaysia’s gross domestic product (GDP) from 4.5% to 5.5% for 2025, further digitalisation of the property industry, national infrastructural enhancements, and increased foreign direct investments (FDIs) and domestic direct investments (DDIs) are all considered contributing factors to the positive momentum in the property market for 2025, according to Henry Butcher Malaysia’s “HB Perspective: Malaysia Property Outlook 2025” report, which was presented on Wednesday (Jan 22).

Almost 50% jump in residential new launches in 3Q2024

In 3Q2024, there was a 47% hike in the number of new residential units launched nationwide to 192,484 units from 183,534 units in 3Q2023. However, the increase in overall value of residential transactions was only approximately 6.8% for the same period.

Meanwhile, the volume of national residential overhang dropped by 13% in 3Q2024 compared to 3Q2023.

The report also cited the Real Estate and Housing Developers’ Association (Rehda) Malaysia Property Industry Survey for 1H2024, which showed that the number of units launched increased by 7% to 11,814 units. According to the same survey, the number of units sold in 1H2024 reached 13,445 units compared to 11,273 units in 1H2023.

“A majority of the units launched in 2024 were terrace houses, which remained the preferred type of property amongst Malaysians, followed by condominiums and apartments,” observed Henry Butcher Malaysia chief operating officer, agency & project marketing Tang Chee Meng during his presentation.

House prices remain relatively unchanged

In terms of house prices, 2024 saw relative stagnancy, with the Malaysian House Price Index (MHPI) only recording slight increases in price across all property types, except for detached houses and high-rises, both of which slipped slightly. Semidees saw the highest rate of increase of 5.4% to 195.1 as at 3Q2024 from 189.7 in 2023.

“However, there is a possibility that house prices might increase, due to developers trying to recoup higher construction costs, as there is a limit as to how much developers can absorb … although, how fast and how much prices will increase depends heavily on the state of the market,” Tang further observed.

The preference for landed properties continues as a major focus for 2025, and the residential market will need to delicately balance developers’ need to increase prices, and homebuyers’ desires for affordability.

“In general, the focus for 2025’s residential market will be on landed properties, as that remains the preference for most Malaysians, as well as high-rises and condominiums in the affordable price range. The definition of affordability will vary for different regions. For example, in smaller towns, this could mean properties priced RM300,000 and below, while in more populated regions, this could mean RM500,000 to RM600,000. Smaller-sized units can help bring down absolute selling prices, which will also increase affordability,” said Tang.

Conversely, niche high-end products may also be in demand for 2025, due to a low supply from developers over the past few years, with some caveats.

“Developers who are looking to launch such projects need to be cautious and savvy with picking the locations of such projects in order to draw in investors,” said Tang.

“As the market is getting more competitive, it is no longer viable for developers to rely on conventionality. It is likely 2025 will see a growing demand for even more sustainable and innovative designs and concepts,” Tang added.

Industrial sector continues to dominate transactions

Malaysia saw an increase of 6.5% in 3Q2024 with the volume of industrial transactions, from 5,935 units in 3Q2023, to 6,320 units in 3Q2024. This was coupled with a staggering 22.8% increase in value (from RM16,829.28 million to RM20,670.53 million), highlighting the industrial sector’s continued position as the best performing sector in Malaysia.

Selangor contributed the most to the national industrial transaction volume, at 33% (2,082 units), followed by Johor, at 18% (1,171 units).

This growth is expected to continue into 2025, with the continued flow of FDIs by large multinational corporations, especially with the upcoming development of more data centres in Johor and Selangor.

“The government has announced that moving forward, it will be focusing a lot on data centres, as well as chip design and manufacturing. So we can expect to see a lot more activity in this sub-sector of the industrial arena,” said Tang.

Infrastructural enhancements across the country will play an increasingly large role in boosting the growth for the industrial sector.

“Improved accessibility between Johor and Singapore through the RTS (Rapid Transit System) link, and the construction of the Mutiara LRT (Light Rail Transit) line to connect Penang island to the mainland, will provide a reason for investors to come in and set up factories in these areas. So, this will provide a boost in demand for industrial spaces,” said Tang.

“The government’s New Industrial Master Plan (NIMP) 2030 as well as the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR) will guide the development of the industrial sector moving forward,” added Tang.

Other government programmes and policies that will continue to grow Malaysia’s industrial sector include the Industry4WRD (National Policy on Industry 4.0) nationwide, and Integrated Development Region In South Selangor (IDRISS).

Incoming mega offices raise oversupply concerns

Purpose-built office spaces (PBOs) have seen a slight increase in supply across Malaysia, from 18.39 million sq m to 18.82 million sq m between Q32023 and Q32024. However, occupancy rates have slipped from 72.7% to 71.6% across the same period.

“In terms of supply and demand, there is a lot more variation across states. For example, in Terengganu and Kelantan, where less office spaces are being built, the market is a lot more stable, versus the Klang Valley,” said Tang.

One of the main concerns for the commercial sector is that the increased construction of mega office towers could cause supply issues.

“Office buildings no longer average out with a net built-up area of 300,000 to 500,000 sq ft. Today, we are seeing office buildings of more than a million sq ft being constructed. This has led to concerns about whether there will be an oversupply of office spaces going forward. If you consider all the statistics, this problem could materialise in the next few years,” cautioned Tang.

In a statement issued by its press secretary, Omotola Ashaolu, the ministry said there are no confirmed cases of the disease in Kwara State.

However, it said proactive measures are necessary to prevent its occurrence and safeguard the poultry industry and public health in the state.

HPAI, a highly contagious disease, causes severe poultry mortality and poses a potential risk to human health.

According to the statement, to ensure Kwara State remains free from this threat, residents, particularly poultry farmers, bird handlers, and agricultural stakeholders, are urged to adopt preventive measures, including:

Strengthen biosecurity measures, restrict access to poultry farms., disinfect equipment, tools, and facilities regularly, and prevent wild birds from interacting with domestic poultry.

The ministry also called for prompt reporting of suspected cases, and for residents to watch for sudden bird deaths, respiratory distress, or a significant drop in egg production, and report any unusual cases to the Veterinary Services Department or relevant authorities for investigation and containment.

Jacques Audiard’s “Emilia Pérez,” a Spanish-language, French-made film, dominated the nominations with a leading 13 nominations, including best picture and best actress for Karla Sofía Gascón. The film also landed nominations for directing, original screenplay, two for its songs and for Zoe Saldaña’ s supporting performance.

Netflix, despite its starring role in Hollywood, has never won best picture. Many of its top contenders have previously racked up large numbers of nominations (including “Mank,” “The Irishman” and “Roma”) but gone home with only a handful of trophies.

“Emilia Pérez,” though, may be its best chance yet. It became the most nominated non-English language film ever, surpassing Netflix’s own “Roma,” which landed 10 nominations.

Only three films — “All About Eve,” “Titanic” and “La La Land” — have scored more nominations in Academy Awards history.

Another musical — “Wicked,” the smash Broadway adaptation — came away with nearly as many nominations. Jon M. Chu’s lavish “Wizard of Oz” riff collected 10 nominations, including best picture and acting nods for its stars, Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande.

“The Brutalist,” Brady Corbet’s postwar epic filmed in VistaVision and released by A24, also came away with a commanding 10 nominations, including best picture, best director and acting nominations for Adrien Brody, Guy Pearce and Felicity Jones.

The 10 nominees for best picture are: “Anora”; “The Brutalist”; “A Complete Unknown”; “Conclave”; “Dune: Part Two”; “Emilia Pérez”; “I’m Still Here.”; “Nickel Boys”; “The Substance” and “Wicked.”

Last year, ‘Oppenheimer’ rolled. This year is different

In a wide-open Oscar race, the six most honored films — “Emilia Pérez,” “Wicked,” “The Brutalist,” “Anora” (six nominations) “Conclave” (eight nominations) and “A Complete Unknown” (eight nominations) — all fared as expected. The biggest surprises were the Brazilian film “I’m Still Here,” a portrait of political resistance under Brazil’s military dictatorship that also landed Fernanda Torres a best actress nomination, and RaMell Ross’ “Nickel Boys,” a daringly crafted first-person POV-shot drama that reconsiders how Black life and pain is depicted on screen.

“Nickel Boys” director RaMell Ross watched the nominations with popcorn Thursday morning in Providence, Rhode Island.

“This film forces a subjective response. It forces someone to speak their mind,” said Ross. “This film is a film that needs discourse. It’s a film that’s built for discourse. The film is a discourse amongst itself. I can’t wait to do it more.”

Those nominees likely displaced a few best picture possibilities in the prison drama “Sing Sing,” the journalism thriller “September 5” and the tender comedy “A Real Pain,” though those films all landed nominations elsewhere.

One of 2024’s most audacious films, “The Apprentice” landed a surprising pair of nominations, for Sebastian Stan and Jeremy Strong. The film dramatises the formative years of President Donald Trump (Stan) in New York real estate under the tutelage of attorney Roy Cohn (Strong). Trump has called those involved with the film “human scum.”

“He called us ‘human scum,’ and I actually feel afraid talking to you about that right now. And that is an alarming feeling to be having in this country in 2025,” Strong said by phone Thursday from his home in Brooklyn.

“On a level of artistry, today, for me personally, is an incredible day and I feel very happy,”

Strong added of his first Oscar nomination. “And I have complicated feelings about the character I played. It was the role of a lifetime and at the same time his legacy is real and it’s playing out in situ in front of our eyes in very frightening ways.”

In the best actor category, where Stan and Brody were nominated, the other nominees were Timothée Chalamet (“A Complete Unknown”), Colman Domingo (“Sing Sing”) and Ralph Fiennes (“Conclave”). Most notably left out was Daniel Craig, acclaimed for his very un-James Bond performance in “Queer.”

Best actress, a category that Demi Moore has appeared to have locked up for her full-bodied performance in “The Substance,” saw nominations for Moore, Gascón, Torres, Erivo and the star of “Anora,” Mikey Madison. Arguably the year’s most competitive category, that left out Marianne Jean-Baptiste (“Hard Truths”), Pamela Anderson, (“The Last Showgirl”), Nicole Kidman (“Babygirl”) and Angelina Jolie (“Maria”).

“I’m a Los Angeles native and so there’s been so much devastation these past few weeks and my heart breaks for LA. but it’s really beautiful to see everyone coming together,” Madison said Thursday. “Hollywood coming together and celebrating film right now is really beautiful.”

In the directing category, “The Substance” filmmaker Coralie Fargeat managed to crack into the otherwise all-male group of Sean Baker (“Anora”), Corbet, Audiard and James Mangold (“A Complete Unknown”). Most had expected Edward Berger to be nominated for directing the papal thriller “Conclave.”

Supporting actor was led by Kieran Culkin, the favorite for the award, for his performance in “A Real Pain.” The other nominees were: Yura Borisov (“Anora”), Guy Pearce (“The Brutalist”), Edward Norton (“A Complete Unknown”) and Strong. Supporting actress nominations went to Grande, Saldaña, Jones, Monica Barbaro (“A Complete Unknown”) and Isabella Rossellini (“Conclave”).

Oscars push ahead, despite fires

The nominations had originally been planned for Jan. 17. But after wildfires on Jan. 7 began burning through the Pacific Palisades, Altadena and other areas around Los Angeles, leaving behind historic levels of destruction, the academy extended its voting window and twice postponed the nominations announcement. Fresh fires outside Los Angeles continued during the nominations, announced by Bowen Yang and Rachel Sennott.

With so many in the film industry reeling, some called on the academy to cancel the Oscars altogether. Academy leaders have argued the March 2 ceremony must go ahead, for their economic impact on Los Angeles and as a symbol of resilience. Organisers have vowed this year’s awards will “celebrate the work that unites us as a global film community and acknowledge those who fought so bravely against the wildfires.”

“We will reflect on the recent events while highlighting the strength, creativity, and optimism that defines Los Angeles and our industry,” Bill Kramer, academy chief executive, and Janet Yang, president, said in an email to members Wednesday.

But much of the usual frothiness Hollywood’s awards season has been severely curtailed due to the fires. The film academy canceled its annual nominees luncheon. Other events have been postponed or downsized. On Wednesday, Kramer and Yang said original song nominees won’t be performed this year. Conan O’Brien, whose Pacific Palisades home was spared by the fires, is hosting.

Blockbusters (mostly) sit it out

The Oscar nominations followed an up-and-down year for Hollywood that saw expansive post-strike delays, wide swaths of unemployed workers due to an industry-wide production slowdown and the tragedy of the fires. Most humbling, perhaps, was the presidential election that returned Trump to office in a race where podcaster Joe Rogan seemed to hold more sway than all A-listers combined.

At the same time, even amid a downturn for the superhero film, the industry rallied behind some galvanising hits, including Universal Pictures’ “Wicked,” and three Walt Disney Co. USD1 billion grossers in “Inside Out 2,” “Deadpool and Wolverine” and “Moana 2.”

Those films missed nominations except for “Inside Out 2,” which joined the best animated nominees of “The Wild Robot,” “Flow,” “Memoir of a Snail” and “Wallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl.” Otherwise, the biggest hits to join the Oscar mix were “Wicked” (USD710.3 million worldwide) and “Dune: Part Two” (USD714.6 million). Netflix doesn’t report box office, so “Emilia Pérez” has no tallied ticket sales, and hasn’t been among the streamer’s top watches, either.

That uncertain state of the movies seemed to be reflected in the nominations, which were spread across films both widely seen and little noticed, theatrically released and predominantly streaming. Several movies that studios and streamers had declined to release — including “The Apprentice” and the Israeli-Palestinian documentary “No Other Land,” which still lacks a distributor — were vindicated with nominations.

But unlike last year, when Hollywood rallied around the success of “Oppenheimer,” this year offered up no clear frontrunner for the industry’s top honor. With five weeks to go until the Oscar ceremony, at least four or five movies — including “The Brutalist,” “Emilia Pérez,” “Anora,” “Conclave” and “Wicked” — are seen having a shot at best

The move comes as the company collaborates with US chip giant Nvidia to deploy state-of-the-art technology, including the latest GB200 Blackwell GPUs, in its AI infrastructure.

YTL Power Managing Director Datuk Seri Yeoh Seok Hong addressed concerns over the proposed US chip export limitations, affirming that the company’s position as the first non-US firm selected by Nvidia to deploy these cutting-edge chips in Asia ensures it will not face any supply chain disruptions. According to Yeoh, Nvidia’s American hyperscalers, including the company itself, will not be subject to the proposed export limits, which should ensure that YTL Power’s plans move forward without issues.

Strategic Partnership with Nvidia

YTL Power’s partnership with Nvidia has positioned the company as a key player in Malaysia’s growing AI data centre sector. As a pioneer in deploying Nvidia’s latest chips, the company will be able to offer AI-driven cloud services and infrastructure, a significant step towards accelerating AI model development. This collaboration was highlighted when Nvidia founder Jensen Huang visited Malaysia in December 2023, where the AI infrastructure project was announced.

The new supercomputer setup, powered by Nvidia’s 72 Blackwell GPUs and 36 Grace CPUs, promises to enhance AI model development on the DGX Cloud platform, positioning YTL Power as a major regional partner for AI applications. Notably, YTL Power’s Kulai data centre is allocating 100 MW of its 500 MW capacity to AI, with the first 20 MW expected to be operational by mid-2025, pending timely chip deliveries.

Impact of US Export Curbs on YTL Power

Despite the market uncertainty surrounding the potential curbs on chip exports, analysts are divided in their views on how the regulation might impact companies like YTL Power. While some believe the export limits could work in YTL’s favor by reducing competition for the GB200 GPUs in the region, others are concerned about the long-term effects on the supply chain.

Under the proposed regulation, US firms can apply for blanket permissions to ship chips to data centres worldwide, but there are concerns about whether Malaysia-based firms like YTL Power will need to secure “Validated End User” (VEU) status to bypass export volume limits. Achieving this status would allow them to receive higher volumes of GPUs, ensuring smooth operations for their AI infrastructure.

Market Reaction and Investor Sentiment

Following the announcement of potential chip export restrictions, shares of YTL Power fell by 11.3% from their January 8 peak of RM4.51, closing at RM4 on January 13. Similarly, shares of parent company YTL Corp Bhd (KL:YTL) declined by 14%. These declines reflect investor concerns over the possible disruptions to the company’s plans, despite reassurances from management.

However, analysts remain largely positive on YTL Power’s long-term prospects. The company is currently trading at a trailing price-earnings ratio (PER) of 10.7 times and a forward PER of 10.9 times, compared to industry peers like Tenaga Nasional Bhd (KL:TENAGA) and Malakoff Corp Bhd (KL:MALAKOF). With 13 ‘buy’ ratings and a target price range of RM3.30 to RM7, the average target price for YTL Power stands at RM5.31, suggesting considerable upside potential.

A Growing AI Presence in Malaysia

YTL Power is not alone in its AI ambitions. Other major players, including Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud, are also setting up AI data centres in Malaysia. These developments signal a significant expansion in the country’s AI infrastructure, with firms vying for access to Nvidia’s cutting-edge chips.

The growing presence of these tech giants in Malaysia highlights the importance of securing reliable GPU access and achieving VEU status, ensuring that the latest technology is available to power AI advancements. For now, YTL Power’s strong ties with Nvidia and its position as a leading player in the AI data centre sector bode well for its future prospects.",1.73775E+12,en,0.302671701,2025-01-23 21:28:35,"['per', 'huang', 'favor', 'divided', 'hyperscalers', 'following', 'time', 'average', 'blackwell', 'supply', 'sector', 'ship', 'oracle', 'work', 'google', 'including', 'klytlpowr', 'reassured', 'founder', 'tenaga', 'surrounding', 'securing', 'priceearnings', 'export', 'nvidias', 'ensuring', 'pioneer', 'stand', 'yeoh', 'market', 'seri', 'move', 'step', 'strong', 'uncertainty', 'expected', 'announcement', 'declined', 'chain', 'collaboration', 'enhance', 'face', 'firm', 'plan', 'smooth', 'kltenaga', 'azure', 'bode', 'offer', 'proposed', 'stateoftheart', 'director', 'january', 'promise', 'others', 'infrastructure', 'concerned', 'prospect', 'rating', 'analyst', 'chip', 'veu', 'validated', 'seok', 'limit', 'asia', 'klmalakof', 'could', 'come', 'presence', 'international', 'ytl', 'power', 'range', 'also', 'suggesting', 'deploying', 'restriction', 'key', 'management', 'embarks', 'buy', 'application', 'regional', 'end', 'bypass', 'setting', 'highlighted', 'malakoff', 'alone', 'potential', 'powered', 'major', 'parent', 'malaysiabased', 'trailing', 'latest', 'player', 'dgx', 'similarly', 'model', 'target', 'possible', 'datuk', 'significant', 'impact', 'curb', 'might', 'positive', 'microsoft', 'giant', 'announced', 'believe', 'view', 'allocating', 'expansion', 'issue', 'delivery', 'managing', 'technology', 'upside', 'partnership', 'investor', 'cpu', 'position', 'platform', 'kulai', 'volume', 'centre', 'without', 'visited', 'affirming', 'secure', 'december', 'fell', 'ratio', 'highlight', 'tie', 'advanced', 'worldwide', 'reassurance', 'tech', 'however', 'future', 'closing', 'addressed', 'signal', 'pending', 'ytls', 'decline', 'trading', 'development', 'apply', 'disruption', 'reliable', 'sentiment', 'region', 'ambition', 'positioned', 'peer', 'bhd', 'leading', 'service', 'grace', 'first', 'operational', 'need', 'higher', 'nasional', 'price', 'vying', 'mid', 'country', 'blanket', 'positioning', 'peak', 'access', 'corp', 'considerable', 'impacted', 'nvidia', 'permission', 'subject', 'ensure', 'amazon', 'effect', 'aidriven', 'capacity', 'collaborates', 'able', 'gpus', 'web', 'despite', 'well', 'achieving', 'nonus', 'company', 'longterm', 'cloud', 'intelligence', 'would', 'remain', 'jensen', 'hong', 'according', 'regulation', 'receive', 'share', 'deploy', 'concern', 'cuttingedge', 'towards', 'partner', 'allow', 'reflect', 'compared', 'growing', 'artificial', 'reaction', 'operation', 'accelerating', 'largely', 'limitation', 'strategic', 'importance', 'forward', 'user', 'status', 'klytl', 'whether', 'available', 'competition', 'advancement', 'data', 'supercomputer', 'industry', 'gpu', 'malaysia', 'selected', 'project', 'notably', 'reducing', 'currently', 'even', 'setup', 'new', 'american', 'timely', 'ensures', 'like']",Neutral

WHAT could be more terrifying than a wall of flame sweeping through the suburbs of Los Angeles? The stealthy cloud of pollution seeping into people’s lungs many miles from the conflagration, which will be causing harm long after the last ember burns out.

Burning palm trees and multi-million-dollar mansions turned into ash make an unforgettable symbol of the damage climate change is wreaking. An even greater toll, however, will be counted in lives cut short not by the violence of a wildfire, but by the slow poisoning unleashed by its flames.

Particulates permeate the air we breathe, whether in cities or the countryside. The ones known as PM10 are about one-tenth the width of a human hair and can penetrate deep into our lungs, where they cause cancer and heart disease. PM2.5 is four times smaller still, and can make it into the bloodstream — and from there, almost every tissue in the human body.

Their effect on human life will endure much longer than the fire itself. About 1,890 people were killed globally in wildfires between 2000 and 2023, with the worst tolls in places similar to the California neighbourhoods currently fighting back the flames: Southern Europe, North America, Australia. Every year, however, nearly 100,000 people die from inhaling PM2.5 released by such disasters, with the worst effects in less affluent corners of Central America, South-East Asia and Southern Africa.

Even in California, it’s the pall of smoke that will do the most damage to human well-being. A drought-prone, densely-populated strip of land strafed by seasonal winds which act like accelerants on a bushfire, it’s unusually prone to such disasters and their after-effects. Somewhere close to 55,000 premature deaths in the state between 2008 and 2018 were caused by PM2.5 from fires, according to a study last June led by researchers at the University of California Los Angeles. That makes such particulates a bigger cause of death in the state than road accidents, and a far more serious risk than homicide.

This blanket of soot extends around the globe. Singaporeans routinely inhale the burnt-up remnants of Indonesian jungles and peat bogs, while New Yorkers see the sun blotted out by the dust lofted when Canadian boreal forests go up in smoke. In Delhi, the fumes from thousands of hectares of rice fields ignited to clear the ground for new planting cloaks a city of 33 million, in a perennial disaster that’s been worsening for many years. The burden of lung and heart disease these disasters engender will be with us for decades to come.

It’s a toll that will never go away entirely. Humanity’s use of fire to cook food and clear the landscape may have had a crucial effect on our evolution, but wildfires have been going on for millions of years before we showed up on the planet and will continue for millions more.

In global terms, it’s not quite right to think that we’re heading into a century of fire, as some have warned. The amount of land that goes up in flames every year, for instance, is falling sharply. The total area burned fell 27% in the first two decades of this century. That’s largely due to a huge decline in fires in Africa’s savannahs, which are increasingly being converted from highly flammable livestock pastures to crops — whose fields act as natural firebreaks.

That’s isn’t enough to reduce the roughly two billion metric tonnes of annual carbon emissions they cause, though. Dense forests in the tropics and the far north are burning more, even as sparse grasslands and savannahs are being spared, so unfortunately the amount of vegetation that’s being turned into CO2 is pretty much unchanged.

Deforestation, meanwhile — one of the biggest drivers of wildfire globally — shows little sign of slowing down. Some 6.38 million ha were lost in 2023, about 45% more than we’d see if we were on track to eliminate the practice by 2030. The climate change that we’re causing, moreover, will intensify the cycles between wet and dry periods. That will give vegetation more opportunities to grow during lush conditions, before becoming fuel for an inferno when the inevitable drought hits.

We’re not going to be able to turn the clock back on this creeping disaster. It will be many centuries before our atmosphere recovers from the damage, even if we assume radical reductions in emissions. Outside of deserts, the polar tundra, the western Amazon basin and a few pockets of northern Europe, almost every corner of the globe is touched by wildfire. The disaster being experienced by Angelenos now — hundreds of thousands evacuated, thousands of homes destroyed, and untold numbers having their lives cut short by inhaled smoke — will soon be coming to a city near you. — Bloomberg

In a note on Friday, it said this projected growth would bring household spending to RM954.5 billion, up from RM907.2 billion in 2024, marking a return to pre-Covid levels.

The research house highlighted that the positive outlook for consumer spending is largely underpinned by low inflation and a stable labour market.

These factors, coupled with strong growth in household incomes, provide a solid foundation for sustained real terms growth in household expenditures.

However, BMI anticipates a slight deceleration in the growth rate, in line with a broader slowdown in Malaysia’s economic performance.

For 2025, the country risk team has forecasted Malaysia’s economy to grow by 4.7% in real terms, a moderation from the rapid recovery seen post-pandemic.

This slowdown is expected to be driven by several factors, including the diminishing impact of base effects, the waning of pent-up consumer demand, tighter credit conditions and a global economic environment that remains subdued.

Despite this, Malaysia’s consumer spending growth is projected to outperform many other markets, with analysts pointing to the country’s resilience amid global challenges.

That said, BMI also highlighted potential risks to its consumer spending outlook.

As major economies around the world stabilise, labour markets are expected to loosen, driven by a reduction in government support and fiscal spending, resulting in a rise in unemployment, presenting a key risk to the consumer outlook for 2025.

Although inflation is projected to remain low, with wage growth improving purchasing power, the potential for job losses could offset these benefits.

Additionally, high levels of household debt remain a significant risk — many Malaysian households are still burdened by debt, which limits future borrowing capacity and constrains disposable income.

The challenge is compounded by rising debt servicing costs, which have been exacerbated by interest rate hikes during the 2022-2023 inflationary period.",1.73775E+12,en,0.01154691,2025-01-24 03:16:09,"['slight', 'rapid', 'outlook', 'high', 'including', 'hike', 'period', 'household', 'real', 'foundation', 'return', 'disposable', 'around', 'exacerbated', 'condition', 'market', 'diminishing', 'strong', 'credit', 'bmi', 'coupled', 'expected', 'borrowing', 'fiscal', 'friday', 'pentup', 'recovery', 'fitch', 'lumpur', 'throughout', 'bring', 'team', 'world', 'performance', 'note', 'grow', 'analyst', 'debt', 'term', 'yearonyear', 'driven', 'limit', 'malaysian', 'could', 'solid', 'inflationary', 'increase', 'power', 'moderation', 'projected', 'economic', 'also', 'expenditure', 'key', 'inflation', 'remains', 'resulting', 'stable', 'favourable', 'postpandemic', 'spending', 'although', 'highlighted', 'potential', 'major', 'benefit', 'factor', 'rise', 'rising', 'labour', 'loss', 'jan', 'significant', 'impact', 'positive', 'wage', 'challenge', 'improving', 'provide', 'see', 'however', 'future', 'subdued', 'base', 'income', 'unit', 'support', 'house', 'slowdown', 'precovid', 'demand', 'cost', 'resilience', 'job', 'sustained', 'global', 'underpinned', 'country', 'reduction', 'forecasted', 'amid', 'loosen', 'research', 'servicing', 'effect', 'tighter', 'unemployment', 'capacity', 'constrains', 'additionally', 'despite', 'growth', 'interest', 'low', 'macroeconomic', 'would', 'waning', 'remain', 'offset', 'solution', 'according', 'stabilise', 'outperform', 'kuala', 'anticipates', 'government', 'economy', 'broader', 'rate', 'largely', 'environment', 'burdened', 'marking', 'line', 'presenting', 'still', 'several', 'malaysia', 'said', 'many', 'purchasing', 'level', 'compounded', 'deceleration', 'pointing', 'billion', 'risk', 'seen', 'consumer', 'continued']",Neutral

Bilateral relations between Bangladesh and Malaysia are expected to deepen through new avenues for collaboration and investment, said Shabbir A Khan, president of the Bangladesh-Malaysia Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BMCCI).

He made these remarks during a reception hosted by BMCCI in honour of Mohd Shuhada Othman, the newly appointed high commissioner of Malaysia to Bangladesh, according to a press release.

The event was attended by ambassadors, high commissioners, diplomats, government officials, BMCCI past presidents, and chamber members.

Bangladesh's exports to Malaysia in FY 2023-24 amounted to $293.51 million, a 9.56 percent decline from $324 million during the same period of the previous year, against an export target of $430 million, BMCCI data shows.

Imports from Malaysia stood at $2.60 billion, down from $3.49 billion in FY 2022-23, narrowing the trade gap to $2.31 billion from $3.11 billion.

Key Bangladeshi exports include textiles, leather goods, jute products, seafood, and pharmaceuticals, while imports from Malaysia primarily consist of electrical equipment, palm oil, machinery, and chemicals.

Khan hailed the strong partnership between the two nations in trade, investment, education, healthcare, and tourism, expressing optimism that the high commissioner's leadership would unlock new opportunities.

State Tourism and Creative Economy Committee chairman Wong Hon Wai said the PIA's growth in total passenger volume of 7.47 million last year, a 7.07% increase compared to 6.97 million passengers in 2023, shows the state’s investments in tourism over the past two years are paying off.

""The increase in flight frequencies was another milestone. In 2024, the airport recorded 565 weekly flights, marking an 8.03% increase from 523 weekly flights in 2023, while international flights, in particular, grew substantially with 304 weekly flights in 2024, a 17.37% increase from 259 weekly flights the previous year.

""This data reflects Penang’s growing connectivity and its role as the aviation hub of northern Malaysia, meeting the strong demand for air services in the region,” he said in a statement on Friday (Jan 24).

Wong also pointed out that the airport welcomed 12 new direct international routes since August 2023, connecting Penang to cities like Dubai, Shanghai, Xiamen, Hong Kong, and more, further cementing its position as an aviation hub for northern Malaysia.

He noted that Penang’s strategic position as a northern region aviation hub, a global semiconductor manufacturing centre and a leading destination for medical tourism has made it a top choice for airlines to prioritise developing direct routes.

In the statement, Wong also highlights that Penang’s growth as a key international gateway is set to continue with ongoing airport expansion plans and with more direct flights in the pipeline, including a new route to Taiwan expected this year, which will also inject new energy into Penang’s tourism industry.

As of now, Penang's international route network connects 20 cities, including Shanghai, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Hong Kong, Dubai, Singapore, Bangkok, Don Mueang, Phuket, Medan, Jakarta, Surabaya, Banda Aceh, Taipei, Ho Chi Minh City, Doha, Xi’an, Chennai, and Chongqing.

""Looking ahead, with the gradual implementation of its expansion plan, I believe PIA’s position as the second busiest airport in Malaysia will be further solidified,” he added.

Data from the Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia (CAAM) dated Jan 19 revealed that PIA has risen to become Malaysia’s second busiest airport in 2024, ranking behind Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) and surpassing Kota Kinabalu International Airport (KKIA) by a narrow margin.

According to the data, KLIA retained its top position with 366,895 aircraft movements last year, followed by PIA which recorded 64,507 aircraft movements, slightly ahead of KKIA's 63,822 meanwhile Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport in Subang recorded 59,929 movements and Kuching International Airport with 54,969 movements. - Bernama",1.73775E+12,en,0.543665886,2025-01-24 06:55:00,"['meeting', 'direct', 'penangs', 'inject', 'including', 'kkia', 'choice', 'solidified', 'pointed', 'surabaya', 'continue', 'aviation', 'welcomed', 'civil', 'medical', 'wong', 'chongqing', 'strong', 'connects', 'minh', 'past', 'george', 'expected', 'another', 'energy', 'friday', 'surpassing', 'pipeline', 'recovery', 'town', 'plan', 'lumpur', 'investment', 'taipei', 'last', 'retained', 'airport', 'shenzhen', 'year', 'airline', 'substantially', 'network', 'added', 'connecting', 'taiwan', 'dated', 'international', 'committee', 'kota', 'increase', 'show', 'also', 'weekly', 'since', 'passenger', 'kong', 'become', 'key', 'kinabalu', 'aceh', 'creative', 'grew', 'postpandemic', 'business', 'margin', 'mueang', 'kkias', 'phuket', 'banda', 'klia', 'abdul', 'state', 'jan', 'revealed', 'northern', 'set', 'meanwhile', 'aziz', 'believe', 'expansion', 'chairman', 'two', 'xiamen', 'risen', 'volume', 'highlight', 'caam', 'position', 'sultan', 'role', 'hub', 'centre', 'previous', 'ranking', 'august', 'doha', 'hon', 'gateway', 'kuching', 'penang', 'statement', 'city', 'looking', 'noted', 'prioritise', 'milestone', 'shanghai', 'flight', 'region', 'narrow', 'demand', 'chennai', 'million', 'subang', 'leading', 'authority', 'global', 'service', 'manufacturing', 'bernama', 'bangkok', 'guangzhou', 'semiconductor', 'amid', 'jakarta', 'route', 'tourism', 'movement', 'implementation', 'ahead', 'made', 'growth', 'slightly', 'total', 'hong', 'according', 'compared', 'second', 'busiest', 'kuala', 'recorded', 'economy', 'particular', 'gradual', 'shah', 'connectivity', 'air', 'behind', 'growing', 'ongoing', 'singapore', 'followed', 'strategic', 'pia', 'top', 'status', 'marking', 'aircraft', 'data', 'reflects', 'industry', 'malaysia', 'frequency', 'said', 'medan', 'chi', 'cementing', 'developing', 'xian', 'paying', 'new', 'wai', 'destination', 'dubai', 'like']",Positive

SABAH has developed a comprehensive approach to create an investor-friendly environment that leverages on the State’s unique strengths under the visionary leadership of Chief Minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor.

Invest Sabah Berhad Chief Executive Officer Dr Firdausi Suffian in an exclusive with Daily Express said Sabah is committed to attracting increased investments into the State.

The strategy centres on providing unprecedented access to vast land resources and tapping into the state's skilled local workforce.

""Our commitment goes beyond traditional investment attraction. We are creating a holistic ecosystem that addresses the diverse needs of potential investors, ensuring Sabah stands out as a competitive and attractive investment destination,” said Firdausi.

He said to a question regarding concerns raised by domestic investors over alleged preferential treatment for foreign investors in power and water supply.

“Chief Minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor has been instrumental in driving this transformative approach. His leadership has been crucial in developing policies that not only attract investments but also ensure long-term economic sustainability for the state,” said Firdausi.

""We are not just seeking investments. We are building a long-term economic partnership that benefits both investors and the local community,” he added.

Firdausi said the initiative is a turning point for Sabah, which is strategically repositioning itself as a hub for sustainable economic growth.

Firdausi coordinating the Malaysia Sabah-China Business Summit on enhancing manufacturing, transportation and logistics.

By carefully aligning investment policies with strategic initiatives, Sabah aims to overcome historical economic challenges and create new opportunities for both domestic and international investors.

He said the key highlights of the strategy include comprehensive access to extensive land resources, leveraging a skilled and adaptable local workforce, developing flexible and competitive investment policies and creating a supportive environment for sustainable business growth.

Here is the rest of the interview

Since the formation of the Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) government, investment and total trade has rose the highest amounting to RM118.1 billion in 2022. In 2023, the total trade amounted to 105 billion. The three digit figure of substantial investment is a significant achievement since the formation of Malaysia.

As of June 2024, China leads in total investment value in Sabah with RM13.19 billion, followed by Korea with RM4.60 billion, according to data from Mida Sabah.

Manufacturing and services.

The new industries include EV production chain such as copper foil and solar glass.

Invest Sabah Berhad is poised to be the One Stop Centre for all investments in which we will facilitate and coordinate interagency and interministerial.

Our sole focus is to highlight Sabah as the powerhouse of emerging markets in this region and therefore the preferred investment destination.

Invest Sabah acts as the One Stop Centre for investment promotion. We facilitate all investment requirements, such as land, power, procedures of permit approval.

Sabah offers various incentives to investors through the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (Mida) and the Sabah Economic Development and Investment Authority (SEDIA).

These include SDC Tax Incentives, which provide income tax exemptions and investment tax allowances for specific economic activities, as well as import and stamp duty exemptions.

Invest Sabah Berhad is committed to conduct due diligence and facilitation for all investment requirements.

Yes, the incentives offered by Mida and Sedia apply to both domestic and foreign investors.

Domestic investments from 2020 to 2024 have been driven by small and medium enterprises (SMEs), with RM16.43 billion contributed by the manufacturing sector and RM18.24 billion by the services sector, significantly boosting Sabah's economy.

Yes, Sabah is China’s largest trading partner, with the state’s exports to China amounting to RM 7.6 billion, representing 19.5 per cent of its total exports in 2023. Key exports include palm oil, timber, seafood, and rubber.

Currently, there is one in planning in Sabah – POIC Lahad Datu was given the approval in principle by MOF Federal on 16 March 2023 to develop a Free Trade Zone and later was changed to POIC Lahad Datu Free Zone (FZ). It will consist of a Free Industrial Zone (FIZ) and a Free Commercial Zone (FIZ).

Besides the already announced POIC port in Lahad Datu, the State Cabinet is seeking Federal approval to declare at least three more Sabah ports as Free Trade Zones (FTZs), including Kota Kinabalu, Sandakan and Tawau.

Sabah is indeed a gateway to the ASEAN’s combined market of over 650 million people. The consumer market in Sabah is increasing, due to the growing of middle-class population with direct access to the Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East Asia Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA), a key regional market with immense growth potential. Concurrently, we also focus on other emerging markets such as China, Taiwan, Hong Kong.

Food manufacturing play a big part in manufacturing sector as a whole in contribution to GDP. Sabah is making significant strides in attracting food production industries, particularly within the halal food sector. This presents tremendous opportunities, as the global halal market is valued at over $2 trillion and is projected to grow to $2.8 trillion.

The POIC Lahad Datu, the first industrial park in the state to be granted Halmas (Halal Malaysia Standard) status. The first phase of this development designates approximately 100 acres for the POIC Halal Hub, strategically located near the POIC Container Terminal, facilitating export activities to the global market.

Positioning food manufacturers within POIC Lahad Datu is a strategic move, offering direct access to the Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East Asia Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA), a key regional market with immense growth potential.

Invest Sabah has undertaken numerous missions and invited as to deliver keynote address in investment summits and conferences such as ESG Conference in renewable energy organised by the Australian Government.

Our upcoming participation would be in Ras AL Khaimah Investment and Business Summit, Kuwait, to tap into the Gulf Market particularly within the Gulf Cooperation Council.

Apart from that, Invest Sabah has joined eight events this year, including seven local exhibitions and one international event in Singapore. Notable examples include the pioneer Sabah International Blue Economy Conference (SIBEC) in Kota Kinabalu, which was a collaboration with the Secretariat of the Sabah Maju Jaya, the Selangor Investment & Industrial Park Expo (Spark) 2024 in Kuala Lumpur, and The Business Show Asia in Singapore.

Sabah is committed to attracting increased investments into the State.

Firdausi (second right) and his team on a mission to be a one stop agency for investment facilitation and promotion.

Our mission is to be a one stop agency for investment facilitation and promotion. And now, we are the one stop centre.

Critics are not right. Yes, Invest Sabah Berhad, is relatively young, but ever since ISB has been established, almost all investments go through Invest Sabah.

We conduct due diligence and facilitation for all investment requirements.

Indeed, Sabah’s favourable climate, fertile soil and strategic location makes it an ideal investment destination for agricultural ventures. However, Sabah is blessed with diverse type of raw materials such as O&G, palm oil, minerals, marine resources, wood to name a few.

The abundance of resources can be allocated for the development of downstream industries in Sabah and therefore not limited to agro-industries.

Apart from downstream manufacturing, the state is also focusing on investment in high-tech fields, blue economy, green energy as potential revenue streams for the state.

In our record, we have none listed so far.

Yes, those are the primary concern. However, the State has been proactively addressing these issues. Power for example, we have Sabah Energy Roadmap Masterplan to address power shortage through incorporation of renewable energy in its development plan.

As for water and other infrastructure, growth precedes development. With the highest record budget, we are confident that the development is central to Sabah Maju Jaya plan.

The expenditure for development will executed in tandem with our aggressive promotions for investments.",1.73798E+12,en,0.553280592,2025-01-26 07:41:39,"['beyond', 'minister', 'sector', 'china',

From remote communities in the Philippines to indigenous communities in Malaysia, partnerships such as with the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) have empowered families to build thriving businesses and support sustainable local food systems.

These programs reflect Aboitiz Foods’ commitment to nourishing the future of Asia by uplifting communities and individuals.

“Aboitiz Foods is committed to fostering thriving communities across the region,” shared Tristan Aboitiz, President and CEO of Aboitiz Foods. “In the Philippines and Malaysia, for example, we’ve empowered families to increase their income through Pilmico Livelihood Kits, designed for farmers, bakers, micro-entrepreneurs, and indigenous communities. These partnerships demonstrate our belief in creating sustainable opportunities, and we are excited to scale these initiatives across the region wherever they can make a meaningful impact.”

Cultivating Sustainable Livelihoods in the Philippines

Since 2017, Aboitiz Foods, through its subsidiary Pilmico and the Aboitiz Foundation Inc. (AFI), has partnered with the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) to uplift Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries (ARBs) and Agrarian Reform Beneficiary Organizations across the Philippines. Through its flagship CSR program, the Pilmico Livelihood Kits, Aboitiz Foods provides grant-based livelihood kits ranging from bakery to poultry and livestock packages, with technical training designed to generate additional income and build sustainable livelihoods. Each bakery kit consists of flour bags, an oven, a baking rack, and other various baking equipment. The egg machine kits include Pilmico Feeds, various animal health products, and 192 ready-to-lay hens. Meanwhile, the gilt package consists of two high-quality breed gilts, along with Pilmico Feeds and animal health products.

Since the program’s inception, it has reached over 1,093 beneficiaries. These resources, combined with training, empower ARBs to enhance their income and build greater resilience, particularly valuable in the face of economic fluctuations. Through hands-on training in farm management, biosecurity, and small business management, they are gaining the knowledge and confidence to build successful businesses.

The company expanded its support for Filipino entrepreneurs by partnering with Ramon Aboitiz Foundation, Inc. – Microfinance (RAFI-MFI) to further empower micro-entrepreneurs in the Visayas and Mindanao regions. This collaboration provides RAFI-MFI clients with livelihood kits, access to capital, and essential business development support.

To date, the partnership has empowered 28 beneficiaries with 10 gilts, 54 egg machines, and 5 bakery packages. By focusing on underserved regions, the collaboration highlights Aboitiz Foods’ dedication to inclusive development and supporting local entrepreneurs in growing their businesses.

Fostering Self-Sufficiency in Malaysia’s Indigenous Communities

Aboitiz Foods extended its community focus to Malaysia through a partnership with the Global Peace Foundation Malaysia, supporting the Orang Asli community in Pahang. This initiative addresses the immediate needs of one of Malaysia’s most economically vulnerable populations while laying the groundwork for long-term resilience.

The program focuses on building sustainable chicken coops, providing chicks and feed, and offering technical training in farm management. This integrated approach helps ensure food security and consistent income for families, contributing to improved livelihoods and overall well-being. The livelihood program has already helped 40 Orang Asli families achieve food security and has provided them with stable income. Further, the initiative includes educational programs for children, fostering a sense of community ownership and equipping the next generation with valuable skills.

“Our vision for these stakeholders is to be able to create programs that will have a long lasting impact on their lives and the lives of those around them. Our investments in programs designed for farmers, micro-entrepreneurs, and Indigenous communities aim to create a more resilient and equitable food system not just for those working today, but for future generations as well. By scaling these partnerships, we’re creating shared value—stronger communities, and a more sustainable food and agribusiness ecosystem in the various markets we serve,” added Aboitiz.

Aboitiz Foods believes that nourishing communities is essential to building a sustainable future for the food and agribusiness sector. The company is committed to expanding these impactful partnerships and creating even more opportunities for families to thrive across Southeast Asia.

By Greenpeace

Japan Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s recent visit to Malaysia and Indonesia highlights the ‘business as usual’ agenda of pushing fossil fuels first, despite just energy transition talks.

Alarmingly, the Asia Zero Emission Community (Azec) Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is doubling down on fossil fuel dependency, undermining global climate commitments and delaying the transition to a truly sustainable energy future.

According to a Zero Carbon Analytics report, only 11% of 158 MoUs, agreed on during Japan Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s recent visit to Malaysia and Indonesia, involves wind and solar, while 35% focuses on fossil fuel technologies like liquified natural gas, ammonia co-firing to supplement coal power plants, and carbon capture and storage.

This approach not only contradicts the urgent need to phase out fossil fuels, it risks locking Asia into a high-carbon trajectory, threatening the region’s ability to meet its climate goals and safeguard communities from the escalating impacts of the climate crisis. At the same time, it diverts critical investments away from scaling up renewable energy solutions like wind and solar.

Oil Change International, highlights the International Energy Agency and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s recommendations to avoid new fossil fuel infrastructure and prioritise the use of existing facilities.

However, the Azec partnership continues to promote and finance the development of new fossil fuel infrastructure, which hinders a just energy transition and climate change mitigation.

Japan, Malaysia and Indonesia continue to view fossil fuels as more secure than renewables. Ironically, more investment is required in making technologies such as carbon capture and storage or carbon capture, utilisation and storage viable in retaining the fossil gas as the baseload.

Malaysia

During his visit to Malaysia, Prime Minister Ishiba expressed interest in expediting the joint crediting mechanism, which promotes carbon credit creation through decarbonisation technologies.

Japan has also shown interest in exporting carbon emissions to align with Malaysia’s carbon capture and storage projects, highlighting the growth interest to ensure investments to make these technologies viable in the future.

Increasing the reliance on fossil gas will prompt further oil and gas exploration as reserves deplete. Petronas has already scheduled new well explorations in Langkasuka and the Tun Mustapha Marine Park.

In addition, Japan is eyeing Malaysia’s rare earth industry to ensure a stable and diversified supply as well as to reduce its dependency on China for critical minerals which are essential for high-tech sectors like automotive, electronics and renewable energy.

Indonesia

Indonesia has the highest number of Azec MoUs signed, 43% of the total. The government must seize this momentum to re-evaluate the 27 fossil fuel-related MoUs and redirect these collaborations toward advancing renewable energy transitions in Indonesia.

The commitment also appears to be in stark contrast with Indonesia’s ongoing plans to promote coal captive power plants for its nickel industry.

CREA and Global Energy Monitor’s latest report on Indonesia’s captive coal capacity, following their 2023 report, finds that sizable growth in captive coal is expected to continue, with an estimated total of 11.0GW up to 2026.

The latter approach risks prolonging fossil fuel reliance, undermining the goal of decarbonisation.

If Japan’s support for Indonesia’s transition to clean energy is to be credible, it should also advocate against investments that prolong the use of coal in industries, such as nickel and fossil gas, which could hinder both countries’ environmental commitments in the long term.

Southeast Asian countries like Malaysia and Indonesia explore nuclear energy as a low- carbon technology and baseload alternative under civilian nuclear energy (CNE) initiatives, undermining the risk of nuclear waste mismanagement and environmental risks.

Greenpeace Malaysia’s climate and energy campaigner Hamizah Shamsudeen said: “Prioritising solar and energy efficiency projects are essential to achieving a just energy transition for Malaysia.

“Japan’s support for the country’s decarbonisation and energy security plan, which includes fossil gas as a baseload, primarily serves the economic interests of Japanese corporations seeking to maintain demand for LNG to be driven by short-term economic gains and ultimately results in environmental and social consequences.

“Decarbonisation efforts should focus on adopting greener alternative resources, such as solar energy. To make solar energy more sustainable for energy security, greater efforts should be directed toward enhancing grid systems and adopting energy efficiency measures in existing and new developments.”

Greenpeace Indonesia’s climate and energy campaigner Adila Isfandiari added: “Japan’s commitment to support Indonesia’s energy security and renewable energy development is promising.

“However, Japan’s track record of investments in coal and fossil gas, including support for large-scale projects like the newly operated Jawa-1 combined cycle gas turbine (PLTGU) power plant in Indonesia, raises questions about Japan’s true commitment to supporting energy transition. This facility, which includes an LNG storage and regasification unit, is Southeast Asia’s largest integrated power plant, with a capacity of 1.7 GW.

“Therefore, to ensure meaningful progress, both governments of Japan and Indonesia must steer this collaboration away from practices that could prolong fossil fuel reliance and instead focus on accelerating clean and renewable energy solutions, such as solar power, which is abundant in Indonesia.”

Greenpeace Japan’s energy project manager Hisayo Takada said: “Prime Minister Ishiba has chosen Malaysia and Indonesia as his first overseas destinations in his new post. Visits to these key Southeast Asian countries are also significant with regard to climate change and energy.

“Japan’s drive to build fossil fuel and nuclear power plants, as well as CCS [carbon capture and storage] and CCUS [carbon capture, utilisation and storage] in both countries, traps both countries and Japan in the old regime of digging and burning underground resources and scrambling to lock up hazardous substances.

“Both countries have a number of things in common with Japan: both are surrounded by the sea, have rich natural environments, active volcanoes and seismic activity, and large populations.

“What both countries and Japan need to pursue is a circular, self-sustaining and democratic way of generating energy, ie renewable energy using the sun, wind and heat from the earth, and not one that is fraught with serious accidents and pollution.” – Greenpeace",1.73798E+12,en,-0.322737634,2025-01-26 09:38:02,"['minister', 'selfsustaining', 'supporting', 'following', 'sector', 'primarily', 'china', 'scaling', 'seismic', 'serious', 'telegram', 'advocate', 'grid', 'liquified', 'operated', 'explore', 'democratic', 'investment', 'threatening', 'youtube', 'reliance', 'oil', 'dependency', 'term', 'must', 'redirect', 'urgent', 'escalating', 'burning', 'power', 'channel', 'surrounded', 'crisis', 'deplete', 'seeking', 'decarbonisation', 'old', 'english', 'momentum', 'alarmingly', 'mineral', 'commitment', 'combined', 'seize', 'significant', 'impact', 'mous', 'hinders', 'sun', 'maintain', 'highlight', 'secure', 'undermining', 'ultimately', 'diverts', 'unit', 'recommendation', 'development', 'prioritise', 'effort', 'reevaluate', 'nickel', 'manager', 'first', 'country', 'ensure', 'tiktok', 'toward', 'whatsapp', 'shamsudeen', 'renewables', 'adopting', 'large', 'viable', 'interest', 'efficiency', 'solution', 'according', 'tun', 'greenpeace', 'accelerating', 'goal', 'cycle', 'includes', 'initiative', 'ironically', 'regasification', 'shown', 'industry', 'turbine', 'malaysia', 'petronas', 'prime', 'risk', 'destination', 'hamizah', 'time', 'intergovernmental', 'regime', 'supply', 'rich', 'doubling', 'marine', 'southeast', 'track', 'addition', 'electronics', 'continue', 'azec', 'shortterm', 'security', 'existing', 'social', 'common', 'largest', 'expected', 'collaboration', 'waste', 'largescale', 'required', 'pushing', 'coal', 'number', 'mismanagement', 'international', 'ammonia', 'economic', 'increasing', 'enhancing', 'key', 'accident', 'business', 'drive', 'creation', 'ishibas', 'mustapha', 'hightech', 'consequence', 'make', 'partnership', 'malay', 'regard', 'region', 'result', 'hisayo', 'global', 'credible', 'ability', 'gain', 'approach', 'facility', 'meet', 'population', 'system', 'government', 'practice', 'away', 'find', 'campaigner', 'delaying', 'storage', 'corporation', 'indonesia', 'therefore', 'project', 'true', 'post', 'resource', 'cofiring', 'meaningful', 'clean', 'mitigation', 'carbon', 'critical', 'substance', 'including', 'sizable', 'integrated', 'directed', 'instead', 'build', 'underground', 'prioritising', 'gas', 'capture', 'safeguard', 'promotes', 'use', 'highlighting', 'energy', 'already', 'avoid', 'advancing', 'plant', 'highest', 'change', 'appears', 'park', 'overseas', 'langkasuka', 'truly', 'greater', 'locking', 'trajectory', 'one', 'supplement', 'talk', 'wind', 'estimated', 'contradicts', 'technology', 'diversified', 'chosen', 'memorandum', 'however', 'future', 'joint', 'adila', 'agency', 'crediting', 'support', 'pursue', 'japan', 'emission', 'demand', 'alternative', 'measure', 'steer', 'need', 'automotive', 'circular', 'align', 'promote', 'active', 'activity', 'thing', 'jawa', 'despite', 'climate', 'phase', 'report', 'prolong', 'community', 'isfandiari', 'finance', 'recent', 'asian', 'monitor', 'volcano', 'scheduled', 'japanese', 'fuelrelated', 'environment', 'fuel', 'usual', 'eyeing', 'making', 'solar', 'new', 'using', 'prolonging', 'takada', 'fraught', 'baseload', 'earth', 'expediting', 'cne', 'way', 'digging', 'sea', 'newly', 'credit', 'fossil', 'mechanism', 'plan', 'instagram', 'rare', 'greener', 'civilian', 'crea', 'pltgu', 'lock', 'infrastructure', 'driven', 'essential', 'stark', 'added', 'highcarbon', 'question', 'asia', 'could', 'progress', 'latter', 'also', 'transition', 'trap', 'hinder', 'continues', 'agenda', 'stable', 'involves', 'lng', 'renewable', 'panel', 'latest', 'long', 'shigeru', 'retaining', 'view', 'ishiba', 'exploration', 'well', 'natural', 'visit', 'record', 'agreed', 'serf', 'raise', 'prompt', 'ccus', 'environmental', 'promising', 'follow', 'scrambling', 'focus', 'capacity', 'understanding', 'achieving', 'exporting', 'growth', 'low', 'nuclear', 'total', 'zero', 'contrast', 'hazardous', 'reduce', 'abundant', 'ongoing', 'generating', 'analytics', 'mou', 'heat', 'said', 'pollution', 'expressed', 'sustainable', 'signed', 'utilisation', 'captive', 'reserve', 'like']",Neutral
export,Malaysia stands to benefit from Trump’s trade policies: KSI and ECKL,1.73789E+12,theSun,https://thesun.my/business-news/malaysia-stands-to-benefit-from-trump-s-trade-policies-ksi-and-eckl-HA13577819,https://news.google.com/read/CBMirwFBVV95cUxNUzJzZXNscVZnLWpaVG1fdmVHZkw2WmV3NnJhUGM2ZkVNX2lkTm1wOFVRbzA4YkpIbWE2d2xyNEZLX0xkRHlQSTZPeWRvbnIyam93amVwM1duSWVidWhMcWFmMUc3Sk1rTjR1Tl9KckFEVWJrZHBkODNfS3VXZ0JRdnh0d3RTcmdOVlFCSHltODhhcHVOTUQzR2ZXT1NLZzZyTkJWOHllTl9jN3AtRW1r?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://thesun.my/business-news/malaysia-stands-to-benefit-from-trump-s-trade-policies-ksi-and-eckl-HA13577819,"KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia is poised to seize significant opportunities from Donald Trump's return as president of the United States, especially in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) and enhancing export potential, according to an analysis by the KSI Strategic Institute for Asia Pacific and the Economic Club of Kuala Lumpur (ECKL).

In a statement, KSI and ECKL said that with Trump’s plan to impose 10% tariff on Chinese goods from Feb 1, companies seeking to shift production lines to other countries may turn to Malaysia.

“For Malaysia, a key exporter of electronic products and components to the US, such measures could impact export competitiveness. However, as companies seek to diversify supply chains away from China, Malaysia’s semiconductor industry, which holds about 13% of the global market in chip packaging and testing, may attract increased investment,” they said.

According to the statement, the intensification of US-China trade tensions under Trump’s policies is expected to accelerate the “China Plus One” strategy, where companies diversify their manufacturing bases outside China.

“Malaysia stands to benefit from this shift, potentially seeing an increase in FDI, particularly in the electronics, machinery, and palm oil sectors. This influx could contribute an additional RM19.7 billion to Malaysia’s gross domestic product over four years, equivalent to a one per cent increase,” it said.

The statement also highlighted the potential impact of Trump’s energy policies, noting that his support for the traditional energy sectors, including fossil fuels, may lead to increased US production and exports. “For Malaysia, a net oil exporter, this could result in lower global energy prices, affecting revenue from mineral fuel exports,” it cautioned.

However, it said, Malaysian petroleum companies could find new opportunities if the US reduces renewable energy incentives, which may result in increased demand for traditional energy sources.

KSI and ECKL said Trump’s return to the White House may also pose challenges that require vigilant and proactive policy responses to safeguard economic stability. They cited Malaysia’s domestic strengths, which include a diversified economy, strategic global position, robust infrastructure, skilled workforce, and strong financial systems.

“Policymakers should capitalise on these strengths by diversifying trade partnerships, attracting FDI, enhancing digitalisation, and building resilience in key sectors. By taking proactive measures, Malaysia can mitigate the potential impacts of Trump’s policies and maintain steady economic growth,” they said.

flood,Tools: Mapping your way out of a disaster,1.73791E+12,The Edge Malaysia,https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/742348,https://news.google.com/read/CBMiUEFVX3lxTE1qZ2d6QlppdDBhV1ZCR0xHdWlHYlRjZmcxWWZMcy1Lb19BQ1FDb1lneXBFOGYzdUprdk0zQ05PWWl1aUNPa3pRc0JZQmNJRG1X?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/742348,"This article first appeared in Digital Edge, The Edge Malaysia Weekly on January 27, 2025 - February 2, 2025

The frequency and intensity of floods have continued to surge because of the effects of climate change and urban expansion into flood-prone areas.

Yet, many drivers in areas that are at high risk of flooding still do not protect their vehicles with flood insurance coverage, says Faiezy Hasnan, chief data officer of Etiqa. This is of concern as nearly one-third of vehicles damaged in floods suffer from total loss and require extensive repair. Insurance payouts help users significantly in covering costs caused by damage to their vehicles.

“I often use add-ons to car insurance as a measure of flood risk awareness. Car insurance is mandatory, but flood coverage is optional, making it a valuable metric for assessing awareness. It is interesting to note that while the east coast has higher flood risk, uptake [in the region] [is] in the single digit. In the Klang Valley, uptake is closer to one-third,” says Faiezy.

“This disparity likely reflects awareness, as policies sold during the monsoon season have higher uptake than those sold during dry periods, despite annual coverage having consistent risk.”

As floods continue to be an annual concern, actionable and location-specific flood data has become crucial for protecting homes, vehicles and businesses.

To this end, Etiqa aims to provide users with the ability to make informed decisions and protect their assets through a flood mapping tool and flood alerts. The tool and alerts will be part of the Etiqa+ mobile application.

Faiezy says the app aims to provide a streamlined experience for users, from early warnings and post-event assistance, to real-time updates on water levels, information of flood-prone areas and a straightforward claims process.

The flood mapping tool, which uses historical data collected from 2020 to 2022, provides real-time flood risk information to users. It allows users to identify regions with high flood risk and be notified on impending flood threats. Users are then able to take preventive measures such as relocating their vehicles from high-risk zones to safer areas, says Faiezy.

The map also allows users to check whether their homes or businesses are located in areas that are historically prone to flooding. This information lets them plan their insurance coverage and make decisions in regard to flood protection.

Meanwhile, the flood alerts will notify customers whenever water levels at nearby stations have reached critical levels. Flood alerts are sent within 15 minutes of water reaching designated danger levels, says Faiezy.

“Malaysia is particularly vulnerable to flooding, especially during the monsoon season, and we saw an opportunity to help our customers manage and reduce flood-related risks before they arise. The flood alert and [mapping] tools are part of our dedication to enhancing customer safety and supporting community well-being,” he says.

Ultimately, Etiqa aims to address the awareness gap in flood insurance coverage, adds Faiezy. This lack of awareness has resulted in the need for flood notifications, without which people will face costly and irreversible damage to their assets.

Data at its core

Data plays a crucial role in the development and effectiveness of the flood mapping tool, says Faiezy. Etiqa uses the data to analyse historical flood patterns, process real-time information and personalise user experiences.

From 2020 to 2024, the company processed more than RM436 million in flood-related claims for more than 30,000 policies. The analysis of these claims offered critical insights into the frequency and financial impact of floods on communities, says Faiezy.

“By applying insights from past events, we’re able to simplify claims processes like waiving the need for police reports during monsoon seasons, as well as provide timely alerts and empower customers with tools to proactively manage flood risk. [In addition], examining patterns in this data [allows us to] identify high-risk areas, anticipate customer needs and tailor our offerings accordingly.

“This data-driven approach enables us to enhance the accuracy of our flood map tool and the effectiveness of our real-time alerts, making our solutions both preventive and responsive.”

Validation processes, which are combined with regular updates, are performed before information is published to users, says Faiezy.

“Our flood-related data is sourced from publicly available information and meticulously processed to ensure accuracy and relevance. We review and clean the latitude and longitude location entries, as some entries may inaccurately point to unintended areas. Through this process, we ensure that our data remains reliable and effective.”

Currently, data for the flood mapping tool is sourced from the government’s Public Infobanjir website, says Faiezy, and there are plans to expand the company’s sources of data.

“We plan to expand the historical range and incorporate additional credible and accurate data sources in future updates [of the mapping tool]. Real-time data integration is also on the horizon as we work to enhance the tool’s relevance, accuracy and value for users.

“We are open to extending this processed data to relevant authorities, such as the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, to support wider flood management efforts. By sharing insights with key agencies, we hope to contribute to a collaborative approach to flood preparedness, enhancing public safety and informing more effective resource allocation in high-risk areas.”

It’s now time to double down on that commitment.” – The Honourable Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, Minister of Housing, Infrastructure and Communities

Quick Facts:

Progress on programs and initiatives is updated quarterly at www.placetocallhome.ca. The Housing Funding Initiatives Map shows affordable housing projects that have been developed. As of September 2024 , the federal government has committed $57.57 billion to support the creation of over 156,000 units and the repair of over 297,000 units. These measures prioritize those in greatest need, including seniors, Indigenous Peoples, people experiencing or at risk of homelessness, and women and children fleeing violence.





The Affordable Housing Fund (AHF) provides funding through low-interest and/or forgivable loans or contributions to partnered organizations for new affordable housing and the renovation and repair of existing, affordable and community housing. This is a $14.6 billion program under the National Housing Strategy (NHS) that gives priority to projects that help people who need it most, including women and children fleeing family violence, seniors, Indigenous Peoples, people living with disabilities, those with mental health or addiction issues, Veterans, and young adults. As of September 2024 , the Government of Canada has committed $10.34 billion to support the creation of over 40,000 units and the repair of over 166,000 units through the Affordable Housing Fund. Budget 2024 announced enhancements to the AHF which includes the program being extended from 2025 – 26 to 2028 – 2029. The existing New Construction Stream is now divided into two dedicated sub-streams: a Rapid Housing Sub-Stream for the creation of shelters, supportive and transitional housing for those in greatest need, and a dedicated Community Housing Sub-Stream to support affordable and mixed-market housing where there are both affordable and market rent units in a project. The Repair and Renewal Stream has replaced minimum requirements with an approach where projects supporting accessibility and energy efficiency will be prioritized.

According to the CBN’s Economic Report for October 2024, this growth was largely driven by increased receipts from the export of agricultural commodities, reflecting Nigeria’s diversification efforts away from oil dependence.

The CBN’s analysis of trade direction shows Brazil as the top destination for Nigeria’s non-oil exports, accounting for 20.22% of the total.

Other prominent trading partners include the Netherlands (15.61%), Malaysia (11.76%), Japan (6.35%), Germany (5.32%), and the United States (5.21%). These destinations underline Nigeria’s growing trade links with diverse markets across the globe.

Cocoa beans emerged as the leading commodity, representing 30.04% of total exports. Urea, a key fertilizer component, followed closely with a 26.59% share. Sesame seeds (5.64%), cocoa products (5.63%), aluminium (3.84%), and copper (3.43%) were also among the major contributors to the surge in export earnings.

Receipts from the top five exporting companies rose sharply, reaching $0.24 billion in October 2024 from $0.13 billion in the previous month. Leading this charge was Indorama Eleme Fertilizer & Chemical Ltd., which accounted for 18.97% of total non-oil export earnings through its urea exports. Dangote Fertilizer Ltd. followed with an 8.72% share, also driven by fertilizer exports. Outspan Nigeria Ltd., a major exporter of cocoa, ranked third with an 8.45% share. Starlink Global & Ideal Ltd. contributed 7.35% from dairy product exports, while Olatunde International Ltd. ranked fifth with a 5.96% share, primarily from cocoa beans.

The report read, in part, “Earnings from the export of non-oil products increased driven, majorly, by higher receipts from the export of agricultural commodities. Non-oil export earnings increased by 19.23 percent to US$0.62 billion, from US$0.52 billion in September 2024. Analysis by direction of trade revealed Brazil as the major destination for Nigeria’s non-oil export products (20.22% of total). This was followed by the Netherlands (15.61%), Malaysia (11.76%), Japan (6.35%), Germany (5.32%), and the USA (5.21%). The major commodities exported were cocoa beans, which represented the largest share at 30.04 percent, followed by urea (26.59%); sesame seeds (5.64%), cocoa products (5.63%), aluminium (3.84); and copper (3.43%). Receipts from the top five non-oil exporters surged to US$0.24 billion, from US$0.13 billion in September 2024. Analysis by share indicated that Indorama Eleme Fertilizer & Chemical Ltd. (18.97%) and Dangote Fertilizer Ltd. (8.72%) were the leading exporters with the exports of urea and fertilizers, respectively. Outspan Nigeria Ltd. (8.45%) ranked third, through the export of cocoa. Starlink Global & Ideal Ltd. followed with a 7.35 percent share, from the export of dairy products, while Olatunde International Ltd. (5.96%) ranked fifth, from the export of cocoa beans.”

The weather conditions are feared to trigger hydrometeorological disasters such as flash floods and landslides. West Java is among those highlighted because the intensity of rain is currently high.

""We must always be alert to potential disasters that may occur,"" said Dwikorita in an official statement on Sunday, January 26, 2025.

Following the strong news about landslides due to heavy rain, such as what happened in Petungkriyono District, Pekalongan Regency, Central Java on January 13, Dwikorita asked the community in areas prone to subsidence. The community is also advised not to dig in areas prone to landslides, and to ensure smooth drainage around the slopes.

""Pay attention to the early signs of landslides, such as the appearance of water seepage, cracks, or slopes that appear to be bulging,"" said Dwikorita,

Referring to the BMKG weather prediction for the next week, the weather will be extreme due to the dominance of the Asian monsoon winds, the influence of weak La Nina, and other atmospheric dynamics. Conditions in various regions, including West Java, have triggered moderate to very heavy rain accompanied by lightning and strong winds.

The Center for Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation (PVMBG) of the Geological Agency has previously mapped a number of areas in West Java that have landslide potential with medium to high scale. The highest scale or areas that must be watched out for the most are in Bogor City, Bogor Regency, Sukabumi Regency, Cianjur, Bandung Regency, Garut Regency, Sumedang, Subang, Majalengka, Cirebon Regency, Kuningan, Ciamis, Tasikmalaya City, and Tasikmalaya Regency.

Floods Submerge Bandung Regency and Surrounding Areas

Acting Governor of West Java Bey Machmudin said that a joint effort was needed to overcome flooding in his administrative area. He had visited the flood location in Dayeuhkolot, Bandung Regency, and the residential area that was also submerged on Jalan Arjuna, Bandung City, on Saturday, January 25, 2025.

""I have spoken with the Head of the River Basin Center. This year, the Citarik River will be normalized,"" he said. ""The addition of retention ponds is also very necessary to reduce the risk of flooding.""

The flood in the Dayeuhkolot area has affected more than 2,500 homes. Flooding on Jalan Arjuna, Bandung City, which originated from the overflowing Citepus River also submerged dozens of residents' houses. In fact, there were houses whose walls were broken by the water.

According to Bey, the flood was due to poor management of development along the river basin. ""Yesterday in Sukabumi, something similar happened,"" he said.

General Datuk Aedy Fadly Ramli, regarding the need for stricter compliance with auction standards for vehicles categorised as Beyond Economic Repair (BER) and Approved Automotive Treatment Facility.

The association said General insurance and takaful companies are working closely with key stakeholders like Bank Negara Malaysia, Ministry of Transport, JPJ, Insurance Services Malaysia (ISM), PUSPAKOM and Malaysian Takaful Association (MTA) on the issue of total loss vehicles.

“We support RTD’s initiative to enforce stringent checks on repaired accident damaged vehicles and strongly advocate for transparency in ensuring that only vehicles deemed safe and fit for road use are allowed back into service. Our primary concern is the safety of all road users, and as such, it is crucial that the vehicles declared BER by insurers, is assessed and repaired appropriately, with all necessary documentation including the roadworthiness certification by a credible Vehicle Inspection Provider (VIP) before the vehicles are permitted on the road” said PIAM.

Vehicle owners are encouraged to ensure that their vehicles are adequately insured by motor insurance, either by considering options from insurers or returning to the original insurer that declared the BER vehicle. For vehicles declared as Actual Total

Loss (ATL), this refers to vehicles sustained severe damage, compromising the structural integrity of the main chassis, to the extent that the damaged motor vehicle cannot be repaired or restored to a safe state, are to be scrapped, PIAM added..

UN Secretary-General António Guterres underscored two escalating global threats: the climate crisis and the unregulated expansion of artificial intelligence (AI). He warned that these challenges pose unprecedented risks to humanity, necessitating immediate, coordinated action from both governments and the private sector.

Speaking at the 55th World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, Guterres acknowledged the vast potential of Artificial Intelligence but cautioned against the dangers associated with leaving it ungoverned. He stressed the importance of international collaboration, referring to the Global Digital Compact adopted at the United Nations as a framework for responsibly harnessing digital technology.

“We must collaborate so that all countries and people benefit from AI’s promise and potential to support development and social and economic progress for all,” he stated.

Calls for commitment to climate action

Guterres also urged the private sector to uphold their climate commitments and called on governments to “keep their promise to produce new, economy-wide national climate action plans this year.”

Need for social media governance reform

In a special address, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez advocated for reforming social media governance across the European Union to combat misinformation and cyber harassment. He emphasized the need for stricter enforcement of the Digital Services Act and expanded powers for the European Centre for Algorithmic Transparency.

Historic initiative for forest conservation

President of the Democratic Republic of Congo Félix-Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo announced the establishment of the world’s largest tropical forest reserve at the meeting. The Kivu to Kinshasa Green Corridor Reserve will safeguard over 550,000 square kilometers of forest throughout the Congo River Basin.

“This historic, unprecedented initiative will transform not only our natural landscapes but also the livelihoods of millions of our citizens,” he remarked, adding that the initiative goes far beyond environmental preservation and includes economic development.

export,Sabah Ports Authority ex-workers’ endless battle for retirement funds,1.7407E+12,The Vibes ,https://www.thevibes.com/articles/news/105341/sabah-ports-authority-ex-workers-endless-battle-for-retirement-funds,https://news.google.com/read/CBMitAFBVV95cUxOWDZjYmJWbFdVY05IQndPbnRYSHhaTTNmQnVJY0Z6YnpwcF9nNkVTSWxVNkFHMl9wa0h5MlE4NmxrZV9MOVFrT3phQjZXbEFTaVBnT01uTlk3UlhhV082TVZfUk9zYWxvT05vb0Vjb2FOS1BNODEtSXpYY2hLdmY0VTVZRVJWcUl3OWR4eEFKbFJJMEZsY3RabXF0ZWt3R2RHdVZqU2JGQ0MzRnJyNWVubmxoWnI?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://www.thevibes.com/articles/news/105341/sabah-ports-authority-ex-workers-endless-battle-for-retirement-funds,"FOR over 30 years, Anthony Jubili has been waiting for money he believed was his.

At 75, he should be enjoying his golden years, spending time with his grandchildren or even playing with his great-grandchildren.

Instead, his days are consumed with worry, while living under the shadow of a retirement fund, he may never see.

“It’s just a matter of time. We’re just waiting to die at this point,” he says bluntly, his words carrying the weight of decades lost in bureaucratic confusion.

Jubili is one of about 300 former employees of the Sabah Ports Authority (SPA) who were part of a retirement scheme designed to secure their old age.

They are now in their 70s and 80s, living across Sabah — from Sandakan to Lahad Datu and Tawau.

According to Jubili, around 30% of his former colleagues have passed on, sadly without receiving their retirement payout, which ranges from RM20,000 to several hundred thousand each.

Most began working at SPA in the late 1960s to early 1970s and served an average of 32 to 35 years before retiring in the early 2000s.

Their hopes were pinned on the Retirement Benefit Scheme (RBS), introduced before the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) system was implemented in Sabah.

Initially, the state port authority contributed 20% of the employees’ salaries, managed by an insurance company under the RBS scheme.

The retirees also received annual Statements of Assurance Benefits as proof that their retirement was secured.

However, when the Harun Commission was introduced in 1975, the RBS was terminated.

The funds were supposed to be transferred to the EPF, which initially was under the government’s directive, allowing retirees to choose between a pension or a lump sum.

However, later under RBS Rule 14, the retirement funds should have been transferred to the EPF.

The rule clearly states that the money would be claimable upon reaching the retirement age of 55 years.

However, SPA made the controversial decision to transfer the funds into The Retirement Fund Inc (Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (KWAP) instead of transferring it to EPF, a move retirees believed violated RBS Rule 14.

It is understood the retirees were not properly informed of this move.

The state port authority’s action resulted in the funds being redirected to KWAP — RM5.8 million in 2012 and another RM1.6 million in 2005, over 10 years after the government directive.

This was what leads to confusion and resentment now.

The controversy revolves around the legal and moral question of whether the retired staff are wrong to ask for EPF after receiving pension and gratuity from KWAP.

Legally, SPA is technically correct in stating that the retirees are not entitled to EPF because they chose the Full Pension Scheme, thus forfeiting EPF contributions.

Statutory regulations under the Pensions Act and Retirement Fund Act state that those who receive pension and gratuity under KWAP cannot also receive EPF.

However, the retirees argue that they are morally justified in demanding EPF because RBS Rule 14 stated that the funds should have been transferred to EPF, giving them a choice between an EPF lump sum payment or pension scheme.

They believe that SPA’s alleged decision to dump the funds into KWAP denied them the choice promised under the RBS.

It seems they were not informed that choosing the pension scheme would result in losing their EPF entitlements.

Legally, the retirees are not entitled to EPF because they opted for the Full Pension Scheme, which forfeited their right to EPF.

Morally and administratively, they have a valid grievance due to alleged mismanagement and poor communication.

RBS Rule 14 promised them a choice that they believe was denied by the state port authority’s decision.

They claim that if Rule 14 had been followed, they would have been able to choose EPF. This conflict between legal technicality and moral expectation is at the heart of the retirees’ continued fight.

Seeking justice, the retirees filed a lawsuit to reclaim their retirement funds.

In 2010, the Kota Kinabalu High Court dismissed their claims, citing the legal principle of ‘res judicata,’ which means the case had been decided and could not be reopened.

The court ruled that they were legally barred from reclaiming the funds, as they had accepted the terms of the pension scheme. It was a devastating blow.

The issue resurfaced in late 2024 when Tuaran MP Datuk Seri Wilfred Madius Tangau raised the matter in Parliament, demanding answers from the Finance Ministry.

The retirees saw this as a glimmer of hope. After years of fighting, their plight was finally being heard at the national level.

In response, the Finance Ministry clarified that the Retirement Benefit Scheme (RBS) was entirely employer-funded at 20%, with no contributions from employees.

The Finance Ministry maintained that the transfer was lawful and final, and no alternative benefits or resolutions would be offered to the retirees.

Efforts to reach out to SPA through the minister in charge, Datuk Shahelmy Yahya, were unsuccessful at the time of writing this story.

Time is running out for many of them. With several already in their 70s and 80s, and others even older.

“It’s heartbreaking to see our friends pass on without ever receiving their retirement money. How much longer do we have to wait?” asks Jubili.

Their fight is about more than just money — it’s a battle for justice, dignity, and the fulfilment of promises made decades ago. - February 28, 2025",1.74079E+12,en,-0.399914116,2025-02-27 22:59:00,"['lost', 'rule', 'lead', 'time', 'receiving', 'full', 'later', 'staff', 'transferred', 'forfeited', 'finally', 'carrying', 'average', 'barred', 'across', 'early', 'older', 'valid', 'dismissed', 'tangau', 'high', 'passed', 'age', 'pension', 'choice', 'allowing', 'revolves', 'instead', 'friend', 'story', 'say', 'justified', 'judicata', 'claimable', 'expectation', 'employerfunded', 'conflict', 'choosing', 'controversial', 'around', 'decade', 'contributed', 'consumed', 'clearly', 'move', 'served', 'demanding', 'blow', 'seri', 'directive', 'ago', 'resulted', 'running', 'retiree', 'supposed', 'transferring', 'heart', 'decision', 'wrong', 'entirely', 'fight', 'die', 'matter', 'another', 'act', 'salary', 'worry', 'secured', 'already', 'court', 'properly', 'opted', 'reopened', 'jubili', 'tawau', 'grievance', 'promise', 'spa', 'year', 'others', 'bureaucratic', 'term', 'annual', 'lawful', 'upon', 'promised', 'may', 'hope', 'reaching', 'longer', 'answer', 'clarified', 'question', 'principle', 'employee', 'began', 'informed', 'mismanagement', 'could', 'kota', 'enjoying', 'port', 'living', 'range', 'transfer', 'introduced', 'reclaiming', 'also', 'violated', 'understood', 'argue', 'harun', 'kinabalu', 'claim', 'morally', 'final', 'confusion', 'entitlement', 'mean', 'technically', 'writing', 'working', 'reclaim', 'spending', 'seeking', 'resolution', 'lahad', 'one', 'moral', 'sadly', 'old', 'benefit', 'state', 'forfeiting', 'ministry', 'saw', 'response', 'alleged', 'ruled', 'resentment', 'datuk', 'dump', 'late', 'believe', 'issue', 'sum', 'offered', 'provident', 'parliament', 'assurance', 'anthony', 'thousand', 'choose', 'gratuity', 'without', 'denied', 'secure', 'commission', 'heartbreaking', 'never', 'filed', 'see', 'pas', 'fund', 'however', 'asks', 'payment', 'case', 'greatgrandchildren', 'point', 'statement', 'citing', 'shahelmy', 'unsuccessful', 'maintained', 'colleague', 'charge', 'proof', 'raised', 'effort', 'glimmer', 'alternative', 'chose', 'golden', 'million', 'stating', 'result', 'authority', 'legally', 'kwap', 'entitled', 'legal', 'waiting', 'plight', 'yahya', 'insurance', 'action', 'statutory', 'administratively', 'retired', 'persaraan', 'poor', 'word', 'playing', 'scheme', 'ask', 'kumpulan', 'decided', 'ever', 'losing', 'able', 'implemented', 'retirement', 'datu', 'justice', 'giving', 'company', 'sandakan', 'national', 'money', 'made', 'controversy', 'stated', 'tuaran', 'terminated', 'former', 'would', 'thus', 'right', 'fighting', 'finance', 'according', 'regulation', 'received', 'receive', 'system', 'believed', 'grandchild', 'part', 'redirected', 'shadow', 'government', 'lump', 'technicality', 'february', 'wait', 'communication', 'day', 'managed', 'followed', 'inc', 'resurfaced', 'madius', 'much', 'sabah', 'wang', 'minister', 'whether', 'reach', 'fulfilment', 'retiring', 'weight', 'due', 'payout', 'lawsuit', 'several', 'correct', 'many', 'contribution', 'level', 'dignity', 'wilfred', 'designed', 'even', 'battle', 'devastating', 'bluntly', 'accepted', 'initially', 'hundred', 'epf', 'pinned', 'continued', 'seems', 'heard']",Neutral
agriculture,Onion Farming Promotion Praised,1.73759E+12,theSun,https://thesun.my/malaysia-news/efforts-to-promote-onion-cultivation-lauded-AB13566215,https://news.google.com/read/CBMijwFBVV95cUxQTmhmbnVOTGxuejAwTnZGaDQxcC1FczhBcXdYVk1TNTMtbmZVRFNRV1pOVmNOc1B2NXlFY3BzX3lyS0ZYb2U5WWJ6LUxqbllzSlQtWkwzWWJvUU9lVjE5OWswMGp6UjJEdVRwVU1QTHQ2bFVlZTN5bEJoNmhtTkVleUxnYmNHY1JKZjlFOTNobw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://thesun.my/malaysia-news/efforts-to-promote-onion-cultivation-lauded-AB13566215,"PETALING JAYA: Malaysia’s push to boost onion cultivation marks a step towards reducing dependency on imports and strengthening food security, but achieving self-sufficiency will require greater effort, said Universiti Putra Malaysia Department of Agribusiness and Bioresource Economics lecturer Prof Dr Norsida Man.

She said Malaysia previously relied on imported onions due to its affordability and lack of

local cultivation.

“Imported onions were cheaper, so Malaysia did not grow it.

Farmers are also more comfortable cultivating other crops.

“The global shortage of onions and export bans by major suppliers underscored Malaysia’s vulnerability to imports, which accounted for 687,000 metric tonnes worth RM1.58 billion in 2022. Last year, when India banned exports due to domestic shortage, Malaysia imported from South Korea, Taiwan and Japan, which was more expensive.”

She said efforts by the government and the Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development Institute (Mardi) in supporting local onion farming are commendable but there is still much that needs to be addressed.

“Mardi introduced new shallot varieties, namely BAW-1, BAW-2 and BAW-3. The varieties are adapted to local soil and climate conditions, and offer hope for sustainable production.”

In 2023, Mardi director-general Datuk Dr Mohamad Zabawi Abdul Ghani said the new varieties were the result of research involving genetic material from local and international sources.

“BAW-1 is vivid red, 25mm to 35mm in size, and thrives in mineral and BRIS (beach ridges interspersed with swales) soils. BAW-2 is pink, 28mm to 32mm, and suitable for mineral and peat soils. BAW-3, also pink but smaller at 18mm to 25mm, can grow well in BRIS, mineral and peat soils.”

He said the varieties could be harvested within 75 days and produce high-quality, disease-free yields.

Norsida praised the developments and acknowledged their potential to reduce the country’s reliance on imports, but cautioned that the future of onion farming in Malaysia is uncertain.

“Malaysian farmers are unfamiliar with the crop as they are more accustomed to spring onions.

“It is important to educate and support our farmers, especially smallholders, to ensure the success of Mardi onion farming initiatives. Farmers need training to adopt new practices, techniques and systems required for onion cultivation.”

She also said it could take a long time to learn the right techniques and smaller farmers must be encouraged to adjust and establish themselves before they can achieve significant production.

Norsida said the integration of modern technology, infrastructure and farming facilities could accelerate progress and with the right support, onion farming could become a viable source of income.

She added that onion farming must be part of a broader strategy to secure food security and reduce reliance on imports.

She said as Malaysia advances its onion cultivation initiatives, the need for sustained efforts and collaboration between farmers, researchers and policymakers to overcome challenges and secure the nation’s food supply is critical.

On Jan 11, Agriculture and Food Security Minister Datuk Seri Mohamad Sabu said local onion cultivation could save the country millions in import costs.",1.73765E+12,en,0.360423744,2025-01-22 23:13:00,"['time', 'adjust', 'supporting', 'minister', 'cautioned', 'unfamiliar', 'supply', 'diseasefree', 'accustomed', 'critical', 'norsida', 'baw', 'import', 'cultivation', 'man', 'india', 'export', 'swale', 'yield', 'condition', 'security', 'seri', 'namely', 'step', 'agriculture', 'acknowledged', 'genetic', 'collaboration', 'tonne', 'mohamad', 'offer', 'domestic', 'last', 'food', 'material', 'source', 'putra', 'year', 'reliance', 'required', 'boost', 'dependency', 'selfsufficiency', 'grow', 'worth', 'directorgeneral', 'bris', 'within', 'must', 'researcher', 'highquality', 'hope', 'added', 'taiwan', 'smallholder', 'strengthening', 'malaysian', 'mardi', 'bioresource', 'could', 'international', 'prof', 'progress', 'introduced', 'affordability', 'also', 'uncertain', 'learn', 'zabawi', 'korea', 'spring', 'become', 'lecturer', 'farming', 'advance', 'production', 'greater', 'push', 'especially', 'policymakers', 'beach', 'shallot', 'major', 'potential', 'infrastructure', 'adapted', 'mineral', 'institute', 'long', 'petaling', 'onion', 'datuk', 'significant', 'banned', 'previously', 'economics', 'jan', 'interspersed', 'encouraged', 'important', 'technology', 'abdul', 'challenge', 'well', 'farmer', 'agribusiness', 'secure', 'mark', 'relied', 'produce', 'cultivating', 'future', 'metric', 'addressed', 'accelerate', 'income', 'pink', 'support', 'suitable', 'development', 'accounted', 'japan', 'achieve', 'effort', 'nation', 'jaya', 'cost', 'sustained', 'million', 'result', 'global', 'harvested', 'need', 'universiti', 'country', 'crop', 'ensure', 'research', 'integration', 'ghani', 'expensive', 'modern', 'south', 'agricultural', 'thrives', 'vivid', 'success', 'achieving', 'climate', 'involving', 'strategy', 'commendable', 'size', 'smaller', 'vulnerability', 'imported', 'viable', 'soil', 'right', 'facility', 'towards', 'save', 'system', 'part', 'lack', 'government', 'cheaper', 'broader', 'red', 'reduce', 'shortage', 'variety', 'day', 'practice', 'take', 'ridge', 'educate', 'sabu', 'local', 'supplier', 'much', 'initiative', 'due', 'still', 'require', 'ban', 'department', 'malaysia', 'adopt', 'said', 'training', 'establish', 'reducing', 'peat', 'billion', 'technique', 'sustainable', 'new', 'overcome', 'comfortable', 'praised', 'underscored']",Neutral
agriculture,Brazil in talks for beef shipments to Japan in threat to US,1.73765E+12,The Edge Malaysia,https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/742265,https://news.google.com/read/CBMiUEFVX3lxTE1aN1VQblRuY1RXYjNfX3g1UEgtQjVoalVVZjMyRER3RXQ3RmJjcFBEWnhBLTVKZ0tHbXY1YlNPZTVTZXk3b3UtYU1xNU1JVWRH?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/742265,"(Jan 23): The world’s top beef exporter Brazil is in advanced talks to begin shipments to Japan, according to a major industry group, in a move that may hurt US sales to the Asian nation.



Brazil has provided Japan with information about its production system and shipments for two decades, and now the industry is optimistic that the world’s third-biggest importer of the meat will finally open up its market, according to Roberto Perosa, who formerly served in the country’s agriculture ministry and is the current president of the Brazilian Association of Beef Exporters.

“There are no longer any sanitary issues in Brazil,” Perosa said in an interview. Japan had previously questioned Brazil’s controls over diseases like foot and mouth. “We now have political momentum,” after the visit of Japan’s Agriculture Minister Taku Eto to the country last year, he added.

A move to allow Brazilian beef into Japan would put rival shipments from the US at risk. The US is currently one of Japan’s major beef suppliers, but the country is dealing with a severe shortage of cattle that drove a spike in US beef imports from Brazil. Cattle futures have been trading at record levels, and the squeeze is expected to last at least into 2026.

More than half of Japan’s beef consumption comes from imports, Perosa said, adding that the country is especially reliant on shipments for beef cuts used as ingredients by the food industry. Currently, most of the Asian nation’s supplies are coming from the US and Australia, at costs higher than what’s typically delivered from Brazil, he said.

“Brazil could complement local beef production as we usually consume less of the kind of meat Japan demands and we have a high supply capacity,” he said.

Perosa is scheduled to visit Japan and Vietnam, another target market for Brazilian beef, in early February. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has a trip planned for March. The world’s fourth-largest beef importer South Korea, as well as the Turkish market, are also among the association’s priorities this year.

Perosa estimates Brazilian beef exports should rise roughly 10% in 2025 with the opening of some of those markets. The industry group is strengthening its international presence, with plans in the first half of the year to open its first offices outside Brazil: in Washington, Brussels and Beijing.

climate_change,Juicy US yields may sap funding desperately needed in emerging-market climate finance,1.73765E+12,The Edge Malaysia,https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/742272,https://news.google.com/read/CBMiUEFVX3lxTFA0T0dtOVRBazd1ZWN5YlJxM3NNUlVuVFlYZE00YS02cDE4bjJIdVRuM3ZCX0d0OFY2NHc4ZWpzTWY0YW5Xcm8xaXBmSk5Mb2RE?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/742272,"(JAN 23): Persistently high US bond yields will force private investors to turn their backs on emerging markets desperately in need of financing to fight global warming.

That’s according to Srini Nagarajan, head of Asia at British International Investment, which is the UK government’s development finance unit.

“If risk-free bonds are giving you 4%-5%,” the question becomes “why would anyone take emerging market risk,” he said. “Interest rates have to come down for fund managers to have an emerging market allocation which goes up.”

US Treasury yields have risen since the Nov 5 election of Donald Trump, as markets digest the steady stream of signals coming from the new president. The US 10-year Treasury rate, a benchmark for global borrowing costs, is now roughly 100 basis points higher than it was back in September.

Nagarajan expects that finding private investors will get harder, especially when it comes to financing early-stage companies working on climate innovation in emerging markets, given high US yields. “How do you justify a mobilization theme when you can’t get commercial investors to work with you?”

And for highly vulnerable economies, such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, the threat of imported inflation is particularly concerning, he added. “At the end of the day, foreign direct investment is needed in all these countries for long-term sustenance,” he said.

Meanwhile, a stronger US dollar has policymakers across Asia’s emerging markets digging deeper into their toolkits to make sure the development doesn’t cause too much local pain.

As emerging markets face a world in which they increasingly struggle to gain access to funding, their need for financing to tackle the fallout from climate change is growing. Moody’s Ratings estimates the developing world requires more than US$1.3 trillion by 2030 to finance measures needed to mitigate the effects of global warming. That’s more than twice as much as what’s necessary for the US and European Union, combined.

There’s also concern that funding from development finance institutions such as the World Bank — the biggest provider of climate capital for developing countries — and the Inter-American Development Bank may see a pullback under Trump. That’s because the US is the biggest shareholder country in both institutions.

“There will be tensions” between the US and these multilateral lenders, said Sean Kidney, chief executive officer at Climate Bonds Initiative. “We won’t see any capital increases for the development banks.”

Nneka Chike-Obi, head of Asia-Pacific ESG ratings and research at Sustainable Fitch, said the US probably won’t contribute to some funding mechanisms established under recent global agreements. Those include “the Loss and Damage Fund and the commitment to increase finance to developing countries from US$100 billion to US$300 billion by 2035.”

The development adds to a broader retreat from climate finance, with global net-zero alliances losing their biggest members amid political attacks in the US.

BII manages about a net £8.5 billion (US$10.3 billion) of emerging Asian and African assets, and has 22% of its portfolio in India, Nagarajan said. It’s looking to allocate more to Southeast Asian markets such as Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines, where it’s exploring avenues such as electric-vehicle infrastructure, battery recycling and green hydrogen.

With the exception of China, where the government and private sector have invested heavily in the energy transition, climate flows to the rest of emerging Asia stagnated at close to US$100 billion annually between 2020 and 2022, with only slight growth in 2023, according to data compiled by BloombergNEF.

Nagarajan said that BII is now beginning to explore blended-finance opportunities, where its presence as a public entity is intended to make projects more attractive to commercial investors. Teaming up with private investors wasn’t “a complete necessity” but that’s changing, he said.",1.73773E+12,en,-0.410068393,2025-01-23 16:25:04,"['biggest', 'direct', 'philippine', 'allocate', 'doesnt', 'donald', 'net', 'sector', 'across', 'annually', 'slight', 'work', 'china', 'bond', 'head', 'highly', 'bangladesh', 'high', 'flow', 'srini', 'particularly', 'bank', 'sustenance', 'struggle', 'southeast', 'digging', 'esg', 'nagarajan', 'pain', 'chikeobi', 'justify', 'exception', 'india', 'vulnerable', 'yield', 'market', 'finding', 'include', 'earlystage', 'tackle', 'explore', 'dollar', 'emerging', 'attack', 'alliance', 'borrowing', 'becomes', 'fight', 'officer', 'probably', 'damage', 'energy', 'face', 'mechanism', 'steady', 'allocation', 'fitch', 'investment', 'coming', 'attractive', 'stronger', 'world', 'year', 'change', 'political', 'rating', 'estimate', 'african', 'desperately', 'retreat', 'infrastructure', 'requires', 'nov', 'added', 'september', 'anyone', 'may', 'member', 'complete', 'question', 'trillion', 'wont', 'asia', 'mobilization', 'mitigate', 'intended', 'come', 'trump', 'presence', 'international', 'multilateral', 'cant', 'whats', 'increase', 'avenue', 'opportunity', 'warming', 'union', 'also', 'since', 'transition', 'blendedfinance', 'contribute', 'changing', 'stream', 'inflation', 'especially', 'policymakers', 'end', 'working', 'pullback', 'asset', 'concerning', 'european', 'riskfree', 'sure', 'shareholder', 'asiapacific', 'combined', 'loss', 'jan', 'meanwhile', 'commitment', 'expects', 'toolkits', 'entity', 'threat', 'make', 'risen', 'force', 'investor', 'lender', 'green', 'pakistan', 'see', 'fund', 'private', 'agreement', 'tension', 'point', 'signal', 'looking', 'unit', 'get', 'benchmark', 'battery', 'moody', 'development', 'necessary', 'kidney', 'cost', 'manager', 'capital', 'global', 'measure', 'need', 'higher', 'there', 'exploring', 'close', 'necessity', 'country', 'compiled', 'election', 'digest', 'commercial', 'turn', 'gain', 'access', 'amid', 'given', 'research', 'innovation', 'financing', 'effect', 'provider', 'fallout', 'deeper', 'losing', 'theme', 'vietnam', 'sean', 'needed', 'climate', 'giving', 'executive', 'hydrogen', 'company', 'portfolio', 'growth', 'longterm', 'funding', 'interest', 'would', 'imported', 'bloombergnef', 'recycling', 'add', 'roughly', 'finance', 'according', 'institution', 'recent', 'concern', 'asian', 'public', 'manages', 'cause', 'government', 'basis', 'thats', 'economy', 'nneka', 'broader', 'netzero', 'growing', 'rate', 'day', 'invested', 'take', 'foreign', 'wasnt', 'interamerican', 'local', 'much', 'initiative', 'electricvehicle', 'treasury', 'heavily', 'chief', 'teaming', 'persistently', 'indonesia', 'data', 'back', 'said', 'president', 'project', 'increasingly', 'beginning', 'established', 'developing', 'billion', 'risk', 'sustainable', 'british', 'new', 'rest', 'bii', 'harder', 'twice', 'stagnated']",Neutral
export,Japan’s small caps on the rise,1.7407E+12,The Malaysian Reserve,https://themalaysianreserve.com/2025/02/28/japans-small-caps-on-the-rise/,https://news.google.com/read/CBMifkFVX3lxTE1zMUR2VVVBOGRGYWNzQW9JTHBtWGdMX29LQUc0LTFFUEtJVkZCaTVWcVl1bE9ZdmE3T3psUWVPeHBiR3htRFd3M25MR1IxRE8zOVNpMDBYaHJtVW43MzI1akRrQ0FQbU9hWDlQcE5MNm5aRzZhN1ptWHA0Y1RwQQ?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://themalaysianreserve.com/2025/02/28/japans-small-caps-on-the-rise/,"A rebound in yen from higher domestic rates may also provide support for the earnings of smaller firms

by IFAST RESEARCH TEAM

SMALLER Japanese companies, often flying under the radar, can represent a tactical complement to large caps. These firms, while less well-known internationally, are benefitting from the same structural changes that are transforming Japan.

Direct Beneficiary of Japan’s Economic Revival

Japan’s economic expansion in the fourth quarter, expanding by 0.7% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ), beating analysts’ expectations of a 0.3% QoQ rise, boosted by a jump in exports. Though domestic consumption remains a lag, we are positive of the future growth in domestic consumption, given the strong wage growth.

One of the key traits of Japan’s smaller companies — typically defined as those with market capitalisations between ¥10 billion and ¥200 billion (RM5.85 billion) — is their domestic orientation. Unlike the export-driven nature of several large-cap firms, smaller companies derive a significant portion of their revenues from within Japan, positioning them to benefit directly from the country’s improving economic fundamentals.

Based on our compilations of over 1,000 Japanese smaller companies, 70% of them generate all their revenue domestically, while another 18% derive at least half of their revenue from within Japan.

Japan’s economy has been undergoing a structural transformation, marked by entrenched inflation. Coupled with a tight labour market and an ageing population, Japan looks to be a path towards a structural rise in real wages.

Firms, which offered the biggest pay hike in three decades in 2024, are expected to maintain the strong momentum this year. Smaller companies stand to benefit directly from rising consumption as higher real wages translate into greater spending power for Japanese households.

A rebound in the Japanese yen from higher domestic rates may also provide support for the earnings of smaller companies. While the Bank of Japan (BOJ) kept rates unchanged in December 2024, governor Kazuo Ueda signalled readiness to raise rates if the economy and prices continue to align with the bank’s forecasts.

The meeting minutes also showed that some policymakers saw conditions falling into place for an imminent rate hike. Smaller companies tend to rely on imported materials and components. A stronger yen thus reduces the cost of these imports, easing margin pressures and improving profitability.

Solid Balance Sheets Underpin Resilience

When one hears the term “small caps”, what often comes to mind are companies burdened by debt. Contrary to this popular belief, Japan’s smaller companies stand out as a notable exception as they tend to maintain considerably strong balance sheets. Years of conservative financial management have led Japanese companies — both large and small — to build substantial cash reserves.

Roughly 60% of Japan’s non-financial smaller companies are in net cash positions. This is notably higher compared to other developed markets, such as the US, where about 40% of non-financial companies in the Russell 2000 Index maintain net cash positions.

With minimal debt obligations, smaller companies in Japan are less vulnerable to rising interest rates. Moreover, their cash reserves provide the flexibility to invest in growth initiatives and increase shareholder returns, whether through higher capital expenditures, increased dividends or share buybacks.

In fact, corporate governance reforms are likely to support growth within smaller Japanese companies. Following its push for higher capital efficiency, the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) has observed significant progress among smaller companies in enhancing their disclosures. The TSE has also adopted a “name-and-shame” strateg y for non-compliant companies — an approach that has proven particularly effective in Japan’s corporate culture.

For instance, 96% of companies with market capitalisations between ¥25 billion and ¥100 billion and a price-to-book (PB) ratio of less than one has already disclosed or considered initiatives to improve capital efficiency as of Nov 30, 2024. This marks a notable 37 percentage-point increase from Dec 31, 2023.

Why does this matter for investors? Better capital efficiency can translate to stronger shareholder returns. Based on indices tracking Japanese smaller companies, return on equity (ROE) is projected to continue its upward trend. Higher ROE would support multiple expansion of companies — a driver of share price appreciation.

The MSCI Japan Small Cap Index and the S&P Japan SmallCap Index are expected to see ROE increase from around 7% to north of 8% by 2026. Meanwhile, the JPX-Nikkei Mid and Small Cap Index boasts a higher ROE of 12%, which is anticipated to remain relatively stable. This is largely attributable to the JPX-Nikkei index’s selection criteria, which include factors such as ROE ranking scores unlike the MSCI and S&P indices.

Attractive Valuations Suggest Potential for Upside

Japanese smaller companies are particularly attractive due to their inexpensive valuations. For instance, approximately 45% of these companies are trading at a PB ratio below one. Moreover, since 2023, the valuation gap in forward PE ratios between large caps and smaller companies has continued to widen.

This divergence in forward PE ratios coincides with the resurgence of Japan’s largest and most prominent companies reflected by indices like the Nikkei 225. Despite benefitting from the same structural changes reshaping Japan, smaller companies gauged by indices like the MSCI Japan Small Cap Index (average market cap of ¥184 billion) remain underappreciated.

In short, investors may view smaller companies as a tactical allocation for diversification and the potential for outsized returns, complementing large cap stocks which have hit record highs in 2024, to achieve comprehensive exposure to Japan.

Kenya will experience below-average rainfall during the March to May rainy season, according to the latest forecast by the IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Centre (ICPAC).

The period, critical for the equatorial region of the Greater Horn of Africa, contributes up to 60 per cent of the annual rainfall in many areas.

The forecast indicates a higher likelihood of reduced rainfall in eastern and northern Kenya, along with much of Somalia, southern and north eastern Ethiopia, Djibouti, coastal Eritrea, and parts of Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and Tanzania.

Regions near the Ethiopia-Kenya-Somalia border, southern Eritrea, and south western South Sudan are also expected to experience below-normal rainfall.

In contrast, wetter-than-normal conditions are projected in most parts of Tanzania, eastern Uganda, eastern South Sudan and western Ethiopia.

ICPAC said there is a high chance, exceeding 70 per cent, that rainfall during the season will surpass 200 mm in south western Ethiopia, western Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and Tanzania.

“There is a high chance (over 70 per cent) that the seasonal rainfall will exceed 200 mm in south western Ethiopia, western Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and Tanzania,” ICPAC said.

Temperatures across most of the Greater Horn of Africa are also predicted to be warmer than average, with the highest probabilities in Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, northern Somalia, and northern Kenya.

Rains onset delays

An early to normal onset of rains is expected in most areas, though ICPAC said delays are likely in central Kenya, southern Ethiopia, and central Somalia.

IGAD warned that the climatic conditions are expected to disproportionately affect vulnerable groups, including women, children, the elderly, and persons with disabilities.

Dr Abdi Fidar, the officer in charge at ICPAC, emphasised the importance of early action to mitigate the impacts of these forecasts.

“As the IGAD region faces increasing climate variability and extremes — droughts, floods, and rising temperatures — platforms like GHACOFs are essential for building a shared understanding of risks and fostering collaboration to mitigate their impacts,” he said.

He added that the theme of this forum, “Climate services for closing the early warning gap together”, highlights the critical role of actionable, timely, and accurate climate information in bridging gaps in preparedness and response.

Ethiopia’s State Minister and Advisor to the Minister of Water and Energy Motumma Mekasa commended IGAD’s contributions to regional integration and climate mitigation efforts.

“We acknowledge and commend IGAD’s role as a regional institution promoting integration and collaboration among member states. In addition to its significant contributions to peace and security, IGAD’s work in coming up with initiatives geared towards mitigating and combating the effects of climate change is essential in making steps towards ensuring sustainable development and safeguarding livelihoods in this region,” he said.

The seasonal outlook was developed using forecasts from nine Global Producing Centres, following procedures recommended by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO).

Public university lecturers and researchers are expected to navigate political discussions with detachment, avoiding any explicit ideological commitment. The official justification for this expectation is that universities should remain neutral spaces for knowledge production, free from partisan influence. Yet, in practice, this enforced neutrality does not necessarily foster genuine intellectual freedom. Instead, it can function as a means of political control, restricting free speech and suppressing critical inquiry.

The idea that scholars must remain “neutral” in political matters is paradoxical. Knowledge is never produced in a vacuum; it is shaped by historical contexts, social structures, and power dynamics. In Malaysia, where political discourse is deeply intertwined with ethnic, religious, and economic considerations, complete neutrality is an illusion. More often than not, the demand for neutrality is selectively applied to silence certain perspectives while allowing others to dominate public discourse unchallenged.

The myth of neutrality in academia

The expectation of neutrality assumes that scholars can exist outside ideological frameworks. In reality, even the choice to remain “neutral” is itself a political stance. When university administrators or the government insist that lecturers avoid discussing politically sensitive topics, they are not fostering objectivity — they are imposing boundaries on what can be said. This creates a climate of self-censorship, where academics hesitate to critique policies, historical narratives, or state actions for fear of professional repercussions.

The concept of neutrality is further problematized by the fact that certain ideologies — particularly those aligned with state narratives — are rarely scrutinized. In Malaysian universities, nationalism, economic developmentalism, and majoritarian religious values are often presented as objective truths rather than ideological constructs. Lecturers who challenge these narratives by promoting human rights discourses, discussing electoral integrity, or questioning government policies are frequently accused of being politically biased. Meanwhile, those who endorse state-sponsored narratives face little to no institutional pushback.

The erosion of free speech in universities

The erosion of free speech in Malaysian universities is not new. The Universities and University Colleges Act (UUCA) has long been used to restrict students and academics from engaging in political activities. Although the law has been amended over the years, the culture of academic self-censorship remains deeply ingrained. Public universities are state-funded institutions, and their leadership is often appointed by the government, creating a structural dependency that discourages dissent.

This suppression is not always overt; it often operates through informal mechanisms such as administrative pressure, denial of promotions, or the withdrawal of research funding. Scholars who engage in politically sensitive research — whether on electoral democracy, human rights, or minority rights — often find their work scrutinized more rigorously than those whose research aligns with state interests. This unequal application of “neutrality” undermines the fundamental principles of academic freedom.

The implications of this restrictive environment are profound. When universities stifle critical discussions, they fail in their mission to develop independent thinkers and contribute meaningfully to national development. Academic freedom is not a luxury; it is a necessity for intellectual progress. Without the ability to question, critique, and debate, Malaysian universities risk becoming institutions that produce compliance rather than knowledge.

Political ideology and the scholar’s role

Some argue that academics should refrain from political engagement and focus solely on research and teaching. This argument, however, ignores the fact that knowledge itself is inherently political. A historian analysing colonial legacies, a political scientist discussing governance models, or a sociologist examining class inequalities — all are engaging with political realities. The expectation that scholars remain politically neutral disregards the fact that their work often has direct policy implications.

Furthermore, academics are not only researchers but also educators. In classrooms, lecturers shape how students understand history, governance, and society. To demand neutrality in teaching is to suggest that all perspectives are equally valid, even when some are grounded in empirical evidence while others are rooted in propaganda. Critical pedagogy does not mean indoctrination; it means equipping students with the ability to analyze, question, and form independent opinions. The real danger lies not in politically engaged scholars, but in those who refuse to challenge prevailing dogmas for fear of retribution.

The need for an honest conversation on free speech

Malaysia’s higher education landscape must engage in an honest conversation about free speech. It is not enough to claim that universities are neutral spaces while selectively policing certain voices. If academia is to contribute meaningfully to national progress, it must be a space where diverse perspectives — especially critical ones — are welcomed, not silenced.

University leadership must recognize that protecting academic freedom is not synonymous with allowing political partisanship to take over. Rather, it means fostering an environment where ideas can be debated openly without fear of institutional retaliation. Policies that protect scholars from political interference and promote a culture of open discourse should be strengthened.

Additionally, civil society and professional academic bodies must advocate for stronger protections against academic censorship. This includes pushing for greater institutional autonomy, ensuring that appointments to university leadership positions are based on merit rather than political loyalty, and challenging policies that restrict intellectual freedom. Malaysia’s scholars should not have to choose between intellectual integrity and professional security.

Beyond the illusion of neutrality

The insistence on neutrality in Malaysian academia is, at best, a well-intentioned misunderstanding and, at worst, a tool for suppressing critical voices. Universities should not be spaces of political indoctrination, but neither should they be spaces of enforced silence. If Malaysia aspires to be a knowledge-driven society, it must abandon the illusion of neutrality and embrace the complexities of intellectual discourse.

Academics have a duty not just to generate knowledge, but to speak truth to power. A university that stifles critical thought for the sake of political convenience is not a university at all — it is an institution of compliance. If the goal of higher education is to foster independent thinking and national progress, then the suppression of free speech in Malaysian universities is not just an academic issue — it is a national crisis.

Canning assemblyman Jenny Choy said the drain had contributed to frequent flooding on Jalan Edward Moreila.

“During heavy rain, there is a ‘bottleneck’ that prevents water from flowing smoothly.

“To address this, Ipoh City Council (MBI) and I applied to the Housing and Local Government Ministry for an upgrading project.

“The application, with an estimated cost of RM200,000 has been approved,” she told reporters after visiting the site.

Choy said upgrading works would require that part of Jalan Keliling to be closed.

She said among the measures that would be taken were replacing the existing drain with a larger one, and changing a 25m-long underground “crossing” route.

“The upgrading works are scheduled to start on Feb 3, and be completed by March 4.

Malaysia's data center sector maintains an optimistic outlook despite new US export restrictions on artificial intelligence (AI) chips, which were implemented in the final days of President Joe Biden's administration.

Industry outlook

According to The Edge, Malaysia's investment ministry is actively working with stakeholders and US officials to address potential challenges arising from the country's Tier Two classification under the new regulations. Deputy Minister Liew Chin Tong emphasized that existing data centers would continue operating normally under the national validated end user (NVEU) designation. The US rules establish a three-tier system for AI chip supply, with Tier Three (non-VEU) countries facing the most stringent controls.

Market response

Zaobao reports that major data center operators, including YTL Power and Mah Sing Group, expect their ongoing projects—particularly their Nvidia partnerships—to continue unimpeded. However, market analysts remain divided on the long-term implications. While JPMorgan has downgraded Malaysian construction companies due to concerns over potential decreases in foreign investment, China Galaxy Securities suggests the impact may be limited, noting that many data centers do not require advanced AI capabilities.

The restrictions appear to have minimal immediate effect on Singapore's data center industry, where numerous facilities are already operational, pointing to a measured but positive regional outlook under the new export framework.",1.73775E+12,en,0.180558413,2025-01-24 00:58:34,"['nveu', 'rule', 'deputy', 'minister', 'divided', 'tong', 'derail', 'sector', 'supply', 'china', 'mah', 'outlook', 'including', 'chin', 'appear', 'administration', 'unimpeded', 'export', 'continue', 'operator', 'market', 'security', 'center', 'existing', 'capability', 'plan', 'investment', 'limited', 'already', 'facing', 'analyst', 'chip', 'classification', 'validated', 'may', 'designation', 'decrease', 'sing', 'wont', 'malaysian', 'construction', 'three', 'joe', 'normally', 'optimistic', 'ytl', 'stringent', 'power', 'galaxy', 'official', 'restriction', 'edge', 'address', 'immediate', 'regional', 'zaobao', 'final', 'end', 'working', 'stakeholder', 'potential', 'operating', 'major', 'group', 'response', 'ministry', 'control', 'curb', 'implication', 'impact', 'positive', 'framework', 'two', 'challenge', 'numerous', 'jpmorgan', 'advanced', 'however', 'emphasized', 'actively', 'operational', 'country', 'maintains', 'measured', 'nvidia', 'effect', 'expect', 'despite', 'implemented', 'suggests', 'report', 'national', 'company', 'longterm', 'intelligence', 'would', 'remain', 'facility', 'partnershipsto', 'according', 'regulation', 'arising', 'noting', 'concern', 'system', 'threetier', 'downgraded', 'minimal', 'day', 'artificial', 'ongoing', 'singapore', 'foreign', 'user', 'data', 'due', 'industry', 'establish', 'projectsparticularly', 'malaysia', 'require', 'president', 'many', 'bidens', 'pointing', 'new', 'tier', 'nonveu', 'liew']",Neutral

Jameson, the world’s most awarded Irish whiskey, has officially announced the return of its annual Jameson Black Barrel Bartender Series, now entering its fourth year. This prestigious competition, open for entries from 13 January to 17 February 2025, invites bartenders worldwide to showcase their creativity by crafting unique cocktails featuring Jameson Black Barrel Irish whiskey.

The competition has gained significant traction, with last year’s edition receiving 355 video entries across 46 countries—an impressive 130% increase compared to 2023. This growth highlights the Bartender Series’ role as a premier platform for showcasing the creativity and innovation of bartenders worldwide, setting the stage for another exciting year of remarkable entries.

Malaysia’s Winning Streak

Malaysia has firmly established itself as a force in the global bartending scene, with two consecutive global winners in 2023 and 2024. Thanesh Joel from Backdoor Bodega and Rohan Matmary from Trigona made history with their inventive cocktail creations, reflecting Malaysia’s rich cultural heritage and culinary creativity.

Speaking about the competition’s potential impact, Claudia Cabrera, one of this year’s judges, noted, “I expect to see bartenders looking backwards in time, using plants and herbology to make cocktails – from tree saps to herbs and roots and beyond. Additionally, I predict we will see cocktails that will bring ancient ritualistic beverages and their ingredients, such as Tejate (prehispanic maize and cacao ‘drink of the gods’) and Pulque (2,000+ year old Mesoamerican fermented agave drink), to the wider world, shining a light on regional culture.”

Rohan Matmary – Global Champion 2024

The competition provides a unique opportunity for bartenders to celebrate their local culture and ingredients while gaining global recognition. With the 2025 edition, Malaysia is poised to continue its remarkable winning streak.

Emerging Trends for 2025

The Jameson Black Barrel Bartender Series has become a barometer for industry trends. Judges predict 2025 to be the year of bold experimentation, with extreme flavour combinations and unconventional ingredients leading the way.

“Minimalism is out, and extremes are in!” Judge Danil Nevsky, known for his innovative approach to bartending, remarked, “Expect to see unseen ingredient combinations in drinks pushed further, like parmesan and espresso, as well as extreme savoury ingredients, such as mushrooms, anchovies and even root vegetables, used to push classics like the dirty martini to the very edge.”

Another trend to watch is the infusion of culinary techniques into mixology. Judge Millie Tang predicts a surge in the use of pâtissier methods, elevating the art of cocktail creation. Additionally, visual experiences such as bioluminescent drinks and dramatic garnishes are expected to captivate audiences.

Prizes and Mentorship

The competition offers more than just recognition. Each of the three global champions will receive a €5000 cash prize, a mentorship programme with industry experts, and an all-expenses-paid trip to Cork, Ireland, to participate in the Jameson HOSTS Global Summit.

Jameson Global Advocacy Manager Tony O’Brien shared highlighted the importance of mentorship, stating, “An addition to the cash prize, the mentorship offers that element of giving back to the industry which we and our mentors are so passionate about, and we look forward to that again this year”

The summit, curated by award-winning bartender Remy Savage, will gather 100+ industry leaders, offering networking opportunities, seminars, and a celebration of the bartending community.

ISLAMABAD, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Ahsan Iqbal said that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a testament to the enduring friendship and shared vision nurtured by Pakistan and China over decades.

Speaking at a ceremony here on Wednesday to celebrate the forthcoming Chinese New Year and to recognize the contributions of 30 outstanding Chinese staff working on CPEC projects in Pakistan, Iqbal said that CPEC represents a roadmap for sustainable development, mutual growth, and prosperity, not only for the two nations but for the entire region.

Highlighting the contributions of the Chinese staff, Iqbal praised their dedication, technical expertise, and relentless hard work, which have been instrumental in transforming ambitious projects into tangible realities.

KUALA LUMPUR – The cities of George Town in Penang, Kuala Lumpur and Johor Baru have been identified for the initial rollout of potential congestion char­ges.

Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Federal Territories) Dr Zaliha Mustafa (pic) said at the Dewan Rakyat that this is still being studied by the Malay­sian Institute of Road Safety Research and the Malaysia Green Techno­logy and Climate Change Corpo­ration.

The aspects studied include the implementation mechanism, potential traffic volume reduction, and increased public transport uptake if a congestion charge is introduced.

The study is expected to be completed by this year.

“If we implement the congestion charge, it can reduce traffic volume by up to 20% in Kuala Lumpur. The charge also cannot be too low but instead discourage vehicles from using certain roads.

ALSO READ : Congestion charge can’t come alone, say groups

“We also do not want the charge to be too high, which can burden the public,” she said during Minister Question Time yesterday.

Citing early findings from the study, Dr Zaliha said similar measures used abroad are also considered for implementation in Malaysia.

Among the measures cited by Dr Zaliha is the Electronic License Plate Reader system in New York, which automatically imposes charges once a number plate is read.

In Singapore, the electronic road pricing mechanism imposes charges according to the zone and specific times to control traffic flow.

In London, there are congestion charge zones where the system imposes charges on vehicles that enter selected cities at peak hours. Dr Zaliha also referenced the road space rationing measure practised in Jakarta and Beijing, where private vehicle use is limited to odd or even numbers depending on the day.

She was responding to a question by Datuk Azman Nasrudin (PN-Padang Serai), who asked about the mechanism used for the congestion charge and the reduction that can be expected.

Dr Zaliha noted that approximately 1.5 million vehicles enter and exit Kuala Lumpur in 24 hours, adding that public transport ridership in Kuala Lumpur was only 25%.

“In this context, I agree with the Transport Minister’s stance that it is not appropriate to impose the congestion charge without a complete and integrated public transport system,” she added.

On Feb 19, Transport Minister Anthony Loke told the Dewan Rakyat that the proposed congestion charge in the city would only be implemented when the public transportation system has been enhanced.",1.74079E+12,en,-0.179391295,2025-02-28 03:43:55,"['certain', 'minister', 'time', 'rationing', 'early', 'feb', 'road', 'high', 'flow', 'integrated', 'territory', 'instead', 'say', 'electronic', 'space', 'appropriate', 'context', 'finding', 'include', 'agree', 'pricing', 'specific', 'use', 'george', 'expected', 'responding', 'referenced', 'zone', 'mechanism', 'town', 'plate', 'azman', 'studied', 'completed', 'lumpur', 'limited', 'odd', 'rollout', 'nasrudin', 'proposed', 'license', 'year', 'change', 'beijing', 'added', 'complete', 'question', 'malaysian', 'number', 'come', 'cited', 'cant', 'aspect', 'introduced', 'also', 'mustafa', 'dewan', 'enhanced', 'considered', 'stance', 'used', 'similar', 'reader', 'alone', 'transportation', 'potential', 'group', 'zaliha', 'exit', 'institute', 'control', 'rakyat', 'datuk', 'impose', 'enter', 'increased', 'uptake', 'technology', 'volume', 'safety', 'anthony', 'automatically', 'without', 'green', 'pnpadang', 'private', 'depending', 'citing', 'penang', 'city', 'among', 'federal', 'charge', 'read', 'noted', 'million', 'ridership', 'measure', 'adding', 'discourage', 'york', 'abroad', 'london', 'reduction', 'identified', 'peak', 'jakarta', 'traffic', 'pic', 'research', 'congestion', 'implemented', 'asked', 'climate', 'approximately', 'implementation', 'low', 'would', 'practised', 'study', 'according', 'public', 'initial', 'system', 'kuala', 'want', 'burden', 'yesterday', 'imposes', 'february', 'hour', 'reduce', 'day', 'singapore', 'vehicle', 'baru', 'corporation', 'still', 'department', 'malaysia', 'said', 'selected', 'serai', 'loke', 'prime', 'even', 'johor', 'using', 'new', 'told', 'implement', 'transport']",Neutral

The Numbers Might Surprise You!,1.73762E+12,Jomfruland.net,https://www.jomfruland.net/is-petronas-dagangan-berhad-undervalued-the-numbers-might-surprise-you/,https://news.google.com/read/CBMinwFBVV95cUxQcGJacm1UdzVWX1lUZ3Q0X2p6WFhnSVg5ZHpEWmRtYkdKeDdwTExOV1ZTOTBHNFBoQUtlWWxFUUxBVnQyb1RmUTFJbE1UTDZvaDg5WnY0QXNNLXl6V3g2bkdDR0ZhYzZ4MDhUSEQ3NjNDSk1OZ0dwM28xc3h2ZjZBZjZKQUY3Q3RXUzVCc0VUYmg3UnN5eEtHQWlidGE4NkU?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://www.jomfruland.net/is-petronas-dagangan-berhad-undervalued-the-numbers-might-surprise-you/,"Analyzing the Fair Value of PETRONAS Dagangan Berhad

Recent assessments indicate that the fair value of PETRONAS Dagangan Berhad is approximately RM16.53. As it currently trades at RM19.38, this situation suggests it may be quite close to its actual worth. Analysts have set a favorable price target for the stock at RM19.40, marking a potential upside of 17% from the estimated fair value.

Determining a stock’s intrinsic value can be challenging, but by applying the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, one can gain valuable insights. This model reflects future cash flows and adjusts them to their present value, considering growth rates over two distinct periods: a higher initial growth phase followed by a stabilization period.

In the upcoming decade, forecasts estimate varying free cash flows, aligning with analyst projections. For instance, from RM1.15 billion initially, it is anticipated to grow, stabilizing as the years progress. The overall present value of these cash flows totals around RM7 billion.

To account for all future cash flows, the analysis incorporates a Terminal Value, taking into consideration the country’s GDP growth average. After this comprehensive evaluation, the estimated total equity value stands at around RM16 billion, indicating that PETRONAS Dagangan Berhad is trading at a price reflecting a balanced market evaluation. However, potential investors should continually assess broader market dynamics and financial health, as the landscape can shift rapidly.

Broader Implications of PETRONAS Dagangan Berhad’s Valuation

The financial health and valuation of PETRONAS Dagangan Berhad do not merely reflect corporate metrics but also resonate throughout the Malaysian economy and beyond. As a key player in the oil and gas sector, fluctuations in its stock price and perceived value can impact investor confidence in Malaysia’s economic stability, particularly amidst a backdrop of fluctuating oil prices globally. The company’s performance ties into a broader narrative about the economic reliance on fossil fuels in a time where sustainability is becoming paramount.

Moreover, the valuation insights highlight significant implications for environmental policies. As the world grapples with climate change, increasing scrutiny on oil and gas companies mounts. Policymakers may view the stability—or instability—of businesses like PETRONAS Dagangan as a bellwether for broader industry trends. If the company maintains healthy cash flows while transitioning towards greener energy initiatives, it could serve as a model, influencing corporate responsibility within the sector.

Looking ahead, the trends indicate a potential shift towards diversification. As the demand for renewable energy sources grows, established firms may pivot strategies. This could lead to an interesting juxtaposition of financial stability from traditional sectors against the backdrop of investments in sustainable practices, reshaping both corporate cultures and consumer expectations.

In conclusion, PETRONAS Dagangan’s market standing not only reflects its internal dynamics but also serves as a critical touchpoint for evaluating broader economic, environmental, and cultural transitions that may define the future of the energy sector.

Unlocking Investor Insights: The Fair Value Assessment of PETRONAS Dagangan Berhad

Understanding the Fair Value of PETRONAS Dagangan Berhad

In the realm of financial investments, determining a stock’s fair value is pivotal for informed decision-making. Recent evaluations put the fair value of PETRONAS Dagangan Berhad at approximately RM16.53. Currently, the company’s shares are trading at RM19.38, which indicates that the stock may be nearing its intrinsic worth. Analysts suggest a favorable price target of RM19.40, implying a potential upside of 17% from its estimated fair value.

How to Calculate Fair Value Using the DCF Model

Determining a stock’s intrinsic value is complex, but the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model provides key insights into future earnings potential. This method involves:

1. Projecting Future Cash Flows: Estimating future free cash flows is essential. For PETRONAS Dagangan, forecasts expect initial cash flows of RM1.15 billion, growing as the company stabilizes over time.

2. Calculating Present Value: The DCF model calculates the present value of these projected cash flows, leading to an aggregated figure of approximately RM7 billion.

3. Incorporating Terminal Value: To finalize the valuation, a Terminal Value is calculated based on the average GDP growth rate in the region. This value captures the potential of cash flows beyond the forecast period, impacting the equity valuation positively.

Market Analysis and Future Predictions

The overall equity value of PETRONAS Dagangan Berhad is estimated at around RM16 billion, positioning the company’s stock price closely aligned with market evaluations. Despite this balance, potential investors are advised to keep a vigilant eye on broader market trends and the company’s financial health, as various factors can influence stock prices.

This launch introduces Malaysia’s first PHEV under RM200,000, with a compelling price tag of RM158,800. The lineup consists of a single variant—the J7 PHEV Premium (2WD).

In conjunction with the launch, JAECOO announced a special early bird package which includes an astonishing 10 years or 1 million kilometer vehicle and battery warranty as well as a free V2L charger which Jaecoo Malaysia says will allow you to enjoy the vehicle at its full capabilities.

Unique features

Compared to the regular ICE variant, JAECOO has designed the J7 PHEV with distinctive exterior elements that set it apart from its ICE counterpart. The standout hero colour is a bold two-tone Olive Grey, enhanced by 19” Aero Rims and aerodynamic side mirrors.

At the rear, the exhaust tips are seamlessly concealed for a cleaner look. A unique highlight is the Cinema Tonneau Cover, which features a white underside that flips into a projection screen—perfect for watching movies or livestreaming sports on the go.

Also, the gear shifter has now been moved from the centre console to the steering column, freeing space in the middle to pack in more of your everyday essentials.

Despite housing a battery beneath the boot floor, the J7 PHEV also offers a larger cargo capacity than its ICE counterpart, providing 500 litres of storage. However, there's a trade-off—no full-size spare tyre, only a tyre repair kit. Folding the rear seats expands the space to 1,265 litres, accommodating even bulkier loads.

Powertrain and performance

The Jaecoo J7 PHEV is equipped with a 1.5-litre turbocharged petrol engine paired with a permanent magnet synchronous electric motor.

This combination delivers a robust total output of 347 PS and 525 Nm, positioning it as one of the most powerful PHEVs in its price segment.

The vehicle accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in approximately 8.5 seconds, offering both efficiency and good performance for urban and highway driving.

Fuel-efficiency and range

In an era where fuel prices might be on the up, the Jaecoo J7 PHEV stands out with its impressive fuel efficiency. It boasts a WLTP-rated fuel consumption of 1.2 liters per 100 km and offers a theoretical range exceeding 1,200 km on a full 55-litre petrol tank.

Real-world endurance tests in Malaysia have demonstrated the vehicle's capability to cover up to 1,427.5 km on a single tank and full charge, with a petrol-only range of 947 km and an electric-only range of 108 km.

This translates to a real-world fuel consumption of 3.5 litres per 100 km, making it an economical choice for both city and long-distance drivers.

Charging capabilities

The J7 PHEV is equipped with an 18.3 kWh battery, built with a 106-cell Lithium Iron Phosphate Blade design, ensuring drivers can charge to 100% while its smart battery management system never lets the charge fall below 20%.

This guarantees optimal battery health and performance throughout its life cycle. Rated to last up to 1 million km, it is fortified with 780 mpa battery armour so that even in a collision, discharge is prevented. It is also puncture-proof.

The J7 PHEV offers versatile charging options to suit various needs. It supports 40kW DC fast charging, enabling a 30% to 80% charge in just 20 minutes, ideal for quick top-ups during busy schedules.

For overnight home charging, the vehicle can be fully charged using an AC wall charger, ensuring it's ready for daily commutes with up to 106 km of electric-only range.

Technology and features

Inside, the Jaecoo J7 PHEV is equipped with a 12.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system that offers wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration.

A 10.25"" fully digital driver’s display provides essential driving information in a PHEV-based layout. The vehicle also includes advanced safety features such as a 360-degree camera, lane keep assist, adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring, and rear cross-traffic alert, enhancing both safety and convenience.

Colours and availability

The Jaecoo J7 PHEV is locally assembled at Jaecoo's Shah Alam facility, ensuring competitive pricing and better accessibility to spare parts and servicing for Malaysian customers.

This local assembly underscores Jaecoo's commitment to the Malaysian market and its automotive industry.

The Jaecoo J7 PHEV comes in Khaki White, Carbon Crystal Black, and Moonlight Silver. Khaki White is a highly sought-after limited edition, with only 100 units available in Malaysia. Once these are sold out, JAECOO will introduce a new Olive Grey option.

With its blend of performance, efficiency, advanced technology, and competitive pricing, the Jaecoo J7 PHEV is poised to set a new standard in Malaysia's SUV market.

Warranty

outbreak,Shopping Across the Causeway: 14 Things You Can And Cannot Buy,1.73769E+12,DollarsAndSense.sg,https://dollarsandsense.sg/shopping-across-causeway-things-can-cannot-buy/,https://news.google.com/read/CBMif0FVX3lxTE5Pb05va09VSW9TVFhmd2d1cHlTbklnck5DelRSaGIweUFFSXB3MGIwTWxYd3ZWd0toYWh3bDBrR1R6Y29TNWJXaTVtUGJQaEUxVE5GTEM1WkVNRUp6djRYaWwxTm50clRYUi1fZ0cwVDJWNTdJWkFGUWZUUFhkTDg?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://dollarsandsense.sg/shopping-across-causeway-things-can-cannot-buy/,"The strong Singapore Dollar (SGD) is a big incentive for Singaporeans to make frequent runs into Johor Bahru (JB) for household groceries, shopping or to enjoy some time off. The higher exchange rate allows many to stretch their dollars for better value on their shopping and holiday expenses.

Before you rush into JB with your family during the CNY holidays (which you can turn into a 5-day long weekend if you apply for a single day of leave!), it’s important to know the things you can and cannot buy. After all, it’s a great opportunity to visit family and relatives while stocking up on cheap deals – but you don’t want to be caught at the causeway and have to throw away your purchases.

Things You Can Buy in JB

Anyone who brings food into Singapore needs to be licenced by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) for food safety reasons. While exceptions are made for those who bring in food for personal consumption, there may be restrictions to take note of.

The Food Safety and Security Bill (FSSB), which was passed in Parliament on 8 January 2025, will allow for even more flexibility on the quantity of food brought in for private consumption. However, it is not yet in force, and current rules and limits on quantity of food brought in for private consumption will continue to apply.

Another thing you should note is that GST may be applicable for your purchases in Johor. While there is a GST relief, it is based on the amount of time you spend outisde of Singapore.

Time spent outside Singapore Value of goods granted GST relief* 48 hours and above S$500 Less than 48 hours S$100

*GST is applicable on the value of goods in excess of the respective relief limits.

#1 Fresh Fruits & Vegetables (Durians Included)

You are allowed to buy a small, reasonable quantity (i.e. hand-carried size) of fruit and vegetable products for personal consumption. When it comes to fruits, many of us can’t wait to savour fresh durians and buy more to share with our families back home. However, taking the strong smell of durians into consideration, it is best that you buy only vacuum-packed durians if you are traveling by public transport such as bus and train.

#2 Dried Confectionery & Processed Food Items

Similar to fruits and vegetables, there is a cap on the maximum quantity of dried food items you can purchase. Each individual is allowed to bring up to 5kg or 5 litres of processed food items, excluding fresh produce and poultry products, and the total value cannot exceed S$100 per person. You are also allowed to buy up to 1kg of cleaned dried bird’s nest with no restriction on the total value.

While this seems little, you can actually purchase up to 20kg of snacks and titbits if you are traveling as a family of 4. You will definitely be able to stock up your snack corner at home and your pantry in office.

#3 Frozen Seafood Items

If you’re into shopping for groceries in JB, you will be happy to know that you are allowed to buy up to 5kg of frozen seafood products including fish (out of which a maximum of only 2kg of frozen cooked crabmeat and cooked prawn meat is allowed). You are not allowed to bring in live seafood from Johor. Refer to the full list of allowed food items and quantities into Singapore under the regulations of Singapore Food Agency.

#4 Personal Care Products

There are no restrictions on buying beauty and personal care products in JB. Apart from pampering yourself with a variety of beauty and wellness services including massage, manicure and hair treatment, you can replenish daily essentials ranging from cosmetics, shampoo, and body lotion, to sanitary pads and dental products.

#5 Fashion & Luxury Items

Ladies can rejoice even more, as you can shop to your heart’s content for new clothes and jewelry pieces in JB with no restrictions. So, it may well be a good time for you to stretch that currency game over the holidays and explore new looks for more #ootd instagram shots.

#6 Plants & Seeds

You can generally hand-carry plants or plant products from West Malaysia, in the following quantities:

3 non-CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) listed plants (without potting)

250 grams of seeds

If you are bringing in excess quantities without valid documentation, you may be detained by the ICA or Singapore Customs Officer when coming into Singapore.

Things You Cannot Buy In JB (Petrol Included)

As much as there are many things you can buy at JB, there are also things that you should avoid buying and bringing back to Singapore at all cost.

#7 Petrol (Not Too Much)

If you drive across the causeway frequently, then pumping petrol definitely tops your list of priorities. However, do note that you are only allowed to enter the Malaysia custom by car with a three-quarter tank. The rule has been implemented to limit Singaporeans from loading up too much petrol, especially with the recent opening of borders in Malaysia. All Singapore-registered cars are also not allowed to pump the subsidised RON95 petrol (but you can still pump RON97 petrol).

#8 Chewing Gum

One of the first few things that many Singaporeans tend to buy after passing the Malaysia custom is likely to be chewing gum. It’s a fuss-free candy that keeps us refreshed (and even addicted sometimes). However, remember to finish all your gums before you return to Singapore because it’s a prohibited item. The only exception is medicated or dental gum, which you would have a clinic-issued slip or receipt as proof of document.

#9 Tobacco-related Products

It is important to note that the definition of tobacco-related products are not only limited to cigarettes. It broadly factors in any product that contains nicotine or tobacco that may be used for application or delivery into the human body, including but not limited to: chewing tobacco, imitation products such as e-cigarettes and vaporisers, smokeless cigar and oral/nasal snuff.

While cigarettes and tobacco products are considered dutiable items (i.e. items you have to pay tax to bring into Singapore), other similar products such as vaporisers and shisha are prohibited items. In addition, cigarette lights that take the shape of a pistol or revolver are also not allowed due to security reasons.

#10 Controlled Drugs And Psychotropic Substances

While certain types of medicine and pharmaceutical products are allowed on the basis that you have an import permit or authorisation form from the relevant controlling authority, there are drugs and pain substances that are strictly prohibited. Some examples are cannabis, cocaine, heroin and inhalants. Refer to the full list of controlled drugs and substances under Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) regulations.

#11 Firecrackers And Fireworks

It used to be an auspicious and fun activity to play with firecrackers and fireworks during the festive season, however they are mostly banned in Malaysia (except for a few types such as Happy Boom and Pop-pop fireworks). Anyone found possessing, selling, buying or playing is punishable by law in the country. In any case, you are not allowed to bring these items back to Singapore, as they are combustible products (i.e. items that can potentially catch fire and explode under heat).

#12 Telecommunication Equipment

Besides obscene articles and publications, other telecommunication equipment is also not allowed. Some examples are scanning receivers, military communication equipment, telephone voice changing equipment and radio-communication devices except cellular mobile phones or other equipment approved by Info-communications Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA). Not to forget, reproductions of copyright publications, tapes and records are also prohibited. Refer to the full list of prohibited telecommunication equipment under IMDA regulations.

#13 Intoxicating Liquors

While you may be able to bring these products in, you have to note that you must declare and pay duties on them. Those who travel may remember buying duty-free alcohol, however, one of the eligiblity criteria is that you are not arriving from Malaysia.

Intoxicating liquors include spirits, wine, beer, ale, stout and porter. Beverages and liquors consumed for health reasons or for cooking are dutiable if the alcoholic strength by volume exceeds 0.5% (eg shandy, bottled alcoholic cocktail drinks, D.O.M., Yomeishu, samsu and rice wine).

#14 Endangered Species And Their Parts

Endangered species of wild life and products derived from the body of such animals, such as rhinoceros horns, are strictly prohibited from your journey back to Singapore. However, you are allowed to buy and import certain breeds of domesticated pets like dogs and cats, provided that you have fulfilled all the necessary requirements published on National Parks Board website.

Do ensure that you have completed all 9 steps (as shown below) before bringing your new furry friend to Singapore.

In summary, here are the items you are not allowed (or require specific authorization) to bring across the causeway.

To keep your shopping experience at JB enjoyable and stress-free, it may be advisable to go for items that are typically allowed. When in doubt, you can always check with the relevant authorities when passing through the custom. Once you are cleared with the dos and the don’ts, it’s shopping time!

The Regional Consultation, held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is part of CABI’s efforts to engage and consult frequently with its Member Countries.

This mechanism helps CABI align its efforts towards national and regional needs, develop joint frameworks for activities with Members and set a path to ensure these are appropriately funded, resourced and translated into vital and effective programmes.

To open the meeting, Dr Daniel Elger CABI’s CEO, and Mr Johari Bin Abdullah, Deputy Director General, Department of Agriculture, on behalf of the Malaysian Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (KPKM), welcomed around 100 delegates from regional CABI Member Countries, partners, and the CABI team.

Member countries and stakeholders review CABI’s strategy and initiatives

The meeting considered CABI’s plan to refresh and extend its current 2023-2025 Medium-Term Strategy to 2028.

Progress made in the Asia-Pacific region under the Strategy was highlighted. Delegates also reviewed some of the key global programmes designed to deliver the Strategy, including the flagship food security programme PlantwisePlus, a proposed Landscapes Initiative based on the approach of integrated landscape management (ILM), and work under the Juno Evidence Alliance.

The CABI Regional Consultation Meetings being held in 2025 have a particular focus on the area of pesticide risk reduction. A series of presentations and workshops on this theme was led by Dr Ulrich Kuhlman, Executive Director, Global Operations.

The topic is highly relevant to health, livelihoods, trade and the environment. CABI already conducts significant work in this area and explored with delegates, who included experts in the field, how this could be further expanded through collaborations at all levels, from the farm to national regulation and policy and international cooperation.

Experiences and lessons from CABI Member Countries were shared and sessions were held to explore barriers and opportunities for the uptake of approaches such as Integrated Pest Management and the use of bioprotection products that can help to reduce pesticide-associated risks.

Opportunity for CABI to align its priorities with those of Member Countries

Dedicated sessions led by Dr Qiaoqiao Zhang, Director of Memberships, were held to consider more broadly how CABI can best address national/regional priorities by joint mobilization of resources and project development between CABI and its Member Countries and partners and by promoting more triangular collaboration and south-south co-operations.

Dr Babar Bajwa, CABI’s Senior Regional Director, Asia, said, “The Regional Consultation meeting was an important opportunity for CABI to align its priorities with those of our Member Countries in the Asia-Pacific region, on this occasion with a specific emphasis on pesticide risk reduction.

“This includes developing plans to adopt more Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices that encompass diverse, safer ways to manage pests alongside judicious and carefully managed use of appropriate chemical pesticides.

“By taking this approach, the risks posed by hazardous chemical pesticides to human health and the environment can be reduced.”

He added that CABI and Member Countries will collaborate on concrete plans to achieve pesticide risk reduction and how they can work together to secure external funding for this work.

Dr Dennis Rangi, Director General, Development, said, “Food security issues continue to both pile up and change, and this means changing tack and doing business differently.

“The power of partnerships and our ability to come together as a membership is what will get us out of this challenging situation. Our Membership is our superpower. It’s what makes us strong – it gives us the diversity that has kept us going for over 100 years. Not many organisations can say they have been around for over a century.”

Mr Johari Bin Abdullah, Deputy Director General, Department of Agriculture, Malaysia, said, “This regional meeting resonates deeply with Malaysia’s and other CABI Member Countries’ commitment to advancing innovation and sustainability in our agriculture sector.

“In a world where our agricultural practices face unprecedented challenges – from pest and disease threats to environmental changes – the need for innovative solutions has never been more urgent.”

CABI’s 2025 Regional Consultation Meetings

Other Regional Meetings of CABI Member Countries will take place during 2025. These include Africa from 11-13 June, taking place in Nairobi, Kenya, and The Americas from 16-18 September, to be held at Port of Spain, Trinidad & Tobago.

These will be followed in early 2026 by a CABI Review Conference of all Member Countries, which will also be focused on project collaboration and funding.

Across Southeast Asia, protecting these wetland ecosystems has emerged as an important priority amid growing risks from fires, haze pollution, agricultural expansion, and forest clearing across the region.

In particular, palm oil plantations and logging that involves digging trenches to transport timber can have a harmful effect on peatlands due to the drainage involved. These practices can dry out peatland forests as well as new agricultural areas, increasing overall hazards from fire, smoke, and haze.

The stakes are long-term as well as severe. Peat is about 90 percent water and 10 percent organic carbon soil accumulated over millennia as a result of the partial decomposition of plant material in waterlogged conditions. When peatland carbon stocks are degraded, they can take centuries to millennia to accumulate again.

Education and awareness on peatland ecosystems are a key component of the SMPEM project to scale the approach adopted in the Raja Musa forest to other peatland regions in Malaysia.

With support from the Global Environment Facility, countries making up the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have been pioneering solutions for the conservation, sustainable management, and restoration of peatland ecosystems that have lessons for tropical countries around the world. A series of GEF-funded projects are showing how peatland restoration and community collaboration can go hand-in-hand, supporting a more sustainable ecosystem with broad benefits.

In Malaysia, peatlands make up three-quarters of the country’s wetlands and are home to important and endangered fauna including Malayan sun bears and clouded leopards; flora such as peat swamp forest trees; and endemic fish species.

As a result of the country’s efforts to preserve its peatlands, some 10 percent of the country’s 2.5 million hectares of peatlands are currently protected under the status of Special Forest reserves, including the Raja Musa forest reserve in Selangor – a site of the GEF’s Sustainable Management of Peatland Ecosystems in Malaysia project, a partnership between Malaysia’s Ministry of Natural Resources, Energy, and Climate Change, the Global Environment Centre – a civil society organization providing technical assistance for the effort and the International Fund for Agriculture Development.

Raja Musa was first developed as a pilot under a GEF-funded ASEAN peatland forest project and is now serving as a demonstration site for what peatland restoration and protection can achieve, particularly when the work happens hand-in-hand.

LONG-TERM SUPPORT FOR SUSTAINABLE PEATLANDS



The GEF has supported peatland ecosystem restoration work across Southeast Asia for decades, starting with the Integrated Management of Peatlands for Biodiversity and Climate Change (GEF ID 1769), which helped pilot the peatland rewetting approach. This was followed by the ASEAN Peatland Forests Project (GEF ID 2751), which worked across the region to combat haze pollution from peatland fires, an initiative that led many countries to develop their own national roadmaps related to the issue. This was followed by country-driven projects including Sustainable Management of Peatland Ecosystems in Indonesia, (GEF ID 5764), Integrated Management of Peatland Landscapes in Indonesia project (GEF ID 9239), and Sustainable Management of Peatland Ecosystems in Malaysia (GEF ID 9270). More recently, the project for Strengthened Systems for Community-based Conservation of Forests and Peatland Landscapes in Indonesia (GEF ID 10731) expanded work on community involvement and peer-to-peer knowledge exchanges. The Sustainable Agriculture and Plantations in Peatlands Landscapes in Malaysia projects (GEF ID 11367) is also aiming to mainstream this approach in palm oil and rice value chains.

During a recent site visit, project manager Ahmad Ainuddin Nuruddin said the peatlands initiative is helping to conserve resources, prevent degradation, and reduce fire risk, with broad expected benefits to current and future generations, already evident through the movement of animals and birds who are spreading seeds between protected and restored areas.

Selangor firefighter using an award-winning fire response technology developed in Malaysia to fight peat fires. These extinguishers work above ground and underground, where peat can otherwise continue to burn for months and trigger new fires.

“Part of Raja Musa Forest Reserve has been affected by recurrent peatlands fires that have degraded the peat swamp forest badly and reduced its biodiversity,” he said. “The fire prevention measures developed by the Selangor State Forest Department have stabilized the water level of the peat and the department has initiated several forest restoration activities. These activities have allowed the planted trees to grow and flourish which will lead to biodiversity recovery in the future … A lesson that we learned from this site is that there is a need for continuous effort in fire prevention activities.”

Restoring peatlands involves multiple steps. In situations where water was drained, dams need to be built in the form of canal blocks or clay dikes to slow the further outflow of water from peatlands. This can increase the water level and rewet the peat, allowing for restoration of peatland. Other interventions include tree-planting and the use of water level monitoring systems. Firefighters have also received training as part of the project, using award-winning technology for underground peat fires developed as part of the Malaysian strategy for combating haze pollution.

It is essential to involve locally-based organizations and community members to properly conserve peatland ecosystems for the long term, Ainuddin Nuruddin said.

""Their role in fire prevention is very important and they can be trained as a fire patrol looking out for fire occurrences during the dry period. They provide fast warning and can relay the information to the fire control crews,” he said. “This fast warning is crucial to fire control and suppression efforts. Local communities have this local knowledge and other peatland local communities can benefit from the sharing of this knowledge.”

Officials have also been working to strengthen national policy and institutional capacities related to peatland restoration and sustainable management, resulting in improved overall oversight. They are seeking to replicate the improvements made at Raja Musa in other parts of Malaysia, with lessons across the region.

Already, the results are visible and showcased in the education center of the reserve, which serves together with the peatland trail as a space for learning, partnership, and collaboration with government agencies, civil society organizations, researchers, and representatives of the private sector and local communities.

As seen from a fire prevention watch tower, the Raja Musa forest reserve is adjacent to palm oil plantations which also benefit from rewetting and fire prevention efforts.

Such knowledge-sharing is at the center of the Malaysian peatland ecosystem management strategy, with lessons learned in Raja Musa being passed on to other regions, including landscapes in North and South Selangor, in Southeast Pahang, in the Klias Peninsula, and in Maludam Peninsula. The private sector is also starting to get involved to ensure protection and sustainable management of peatlands, with companies in the palm oil sector and other parts of the agricultural value chain taking part in a recent workshop on sustainable agriculture.",1.73773E+12,en,0.088662155,2025-01-23 12:00:00,"['broad', 'supporting', 'tower', 'malayan', 'sector', 'policy', 'period', 'involved', 'countrydriven', 'outflow', 'space', 'protecting', 'peatland', 'condition', 'develop', 'center', 'demonstration', 'fight', 'degraded', 'recovery', 'trained', 'visible', 'awardwinning', 'material', 'component', 'world', 'oil', 'term', 'value', 'researcher', 'malaysian', 'prevention', 'together', 'increase', 'slow', 'living', 'expanded', 'evident', 'relay', 'exchange', 'resulting', 'protection', 'seeking', 'badly', 'ministry', 'related', 'smoke', 'otherwise', 'issue', 'sun', 'haze', 'provide', 'reduced', 'situation', 'extinguisher', 'landscape', 'development', 'achieve', 'nation', 'waterlogged', 'effort', 'million', 'manager', 'first', 'harmful', 'country', 'amid', 'ensure', 'national', 'made', 'longterm', 'tree', 'soil', 'solution', 'site', 'awareness', 'smpem', 'showcased', 'restoring', 'growing', 'geffunded', 'take', 'swamp', 'handinhand', 'initiative', 'affected', 'adopted', 'due', 'knowledgesharing', 'malaysia', 'clouded', 'risk', 'combat', 'wellbeing', 'patrol', 'scale', 'supply', 'involvement', 'across', 'generation', 'allowing', 'southeast', 'musa', 'continue', 'decade', 'peatlands', 'include', 'expected', 'collaboration', 'continuous', 'severe', 'dike', 'trail', 'treeplanting', 'grow', 'allowed', 'replicate', 'current', 'taking', 'international', 'clay', 'specie', 'monitoring', 'organization', 'rice', 'logging', 'increasing', 'stake', 'key', 'recently', 'ainuddin', 'showing', 'dam', 'drained', 'block', 'association', 'endemic', 'form', 'control', 'important', 'make', 'providing', 'society', 'led', 'partnership', 'private', 'ahmad', 'get', 'water', 'education', 'region', 'millennium', 'result', 'global', 'information', 'overall', 'burn', 'biodiversity', 'nuruddin', 'organic', 'seed', 'technical', 'peninsula', 'effect', 'mainstream', 'agricultural', 'happens', 'approach', 'fire', 'trigger', 'facility', 'system', 'roadmaps', 'government', 'partial', 'combating', 'practice', 'leopard', 'gefs', 'hectare', 'percent', 'local', 'raja', 'indonesia', 'palm', 'training', 'project', 'currently', 'seen', 'recurrent', 'tropical', 'resource', 'oversight', 'firefighter', 'lead', 'communitybased', 'strengthened', 'klias', 'asean', 'carbon', 'including', 'particularly', 'bear', 'developed', 'integrated', 'underground', 'pilot', 'clearing', 'timber', 'crucial', 'step', 'agriculture', 'use', 'drainage', 'energy', 'chain', 'degradation', 'representative', 'vital', 'already', 'month', 'properly', 'plant', 'priority', 'change', 'wetland', 'member', 'institutional', 'watch', 'sharing', 'planted', 'working', 'plantation', 'benefit', 'fish', 'prevent', 'response', 'serving', 'near', 'flourish', 'animal', 'technology', 'hazard', 'locallybased', 'stock', 'initiated', 'role', 'centre', 'rewetting', 'conserve', 'future', 'play', 'looking', 'agency', 'support', 'pioneering', 'measure', 'preserve', 'need', 'strengthen', 'activity', 'multiple', 'south', 'ecosystem', 'climate', 'strategy', 'fast', 'community', 'peertopeer', 'recent', 'asian', 'gef', 'maludam', 'environment', 'home', 'forest', 'involve', 'department', 'several', 'many', 'level', 'peat', 'fauna', 'making', 'new', 'using', 'suppression', 'transport', 'accumulate', 'supported', 'knowledge', 'helping', 'lesson', 'work', 'passed', 'spreading', 'digging', 'workshop', 'conservation', 'trench', 'around', 'civil', 'canal', 'warning', 'learned', 'dry', 'series', 'protected', 'essential', 'decomposition', 'accumulated', 'asia', 'learning', 'also', 'improvement', 'area', 'official', 'management', 'threequarters', 'special', 'involves', 'starting', 'stabilized', 'state', 'long', 'expansion', 'selangor', 'well', 'assistance', 'natural', 'helped', 'fund', 'visit', 'improved', 'serf', 'restored', 'bird', 'rewet', 'capacity', 'movement', 'company', 'aiming', 'ground', 'built', 'received', 'century', 'north', 'part', 'particular', 'flora', 'reduce', 'endangered', 'crew', 'followed', 'status', 'restoration', 'intervention', 'adjacent', 'worked', 'said', 'pollution', 'occurrence', 'sustainable', 'emerged', 'reserve', 'pahang']",Neutral

Kamakura’s beloved Warabimochi has arrived in Malaysia, bringing an authentic taste of Japan through its pop-up store at APW Bangsar.

At the limited-time showcase, guests can savour freshly made Warabimochi while exploring the rich history behind the beloved dessert made with meticulous craftsmanship. Yes, you can watch it being made in front of you!

During the launch, guests also tried various Warabimochi drink flavours such as Asakawa-en Matcha, Tenku no Hojicha, and Strawberry Milk.

The Warabimochi pieces were cut small enough so they’re easy to slurp and enjoy the drink as a whole. Kamakura’s Warabimochi is made silky soft so you don’t have to chew your drink that much.

What is Warabimochi?

Warabimochi is a traditional Japanese dessert with jelly-like texture and is often served chilled with kinako (toasted soybean flour) and kuromitsu (brown sugar syrup).

Warabimochi has a rich history dating back to the Heian period. It was initially a luxury dessert enjoyed by people of high status, including Emperor Daigo. It evolved into its modern form during the Kamakura period, influenced by Chinese dim sum culture and Japanese tea ceremony traditions.

Kamakura’s Warabimochi is unique because it’s prepared using a secret blend of premium Japanese “warabi powder.” Before serving, it’s generally dusted with high-quality, deeply roasted kinako, and drizzled with Kamakura’s homemade kuromitsu, made exclusively with Okinawan black sugar.

Its signature Warabimochi features a uniquely soft and melt-in-your-mouth texture, achieved through the skilled kneading techniques of expert artisans.

Warabimochi Kamakura also uses high-quality matcha from Asakawaen, known for its fragrance and vibrant colour, to make its drinks.

Warabimochi Kamakura has stellar success and quickly captivated a loyal following in Singapore, Hong Kong, China, and Australia for its commitment to quality and authenticity.

Have a taste (or two)

The exclusive pop-up in APW Bangsar will run for two months from 20 February 2025.

Don’t worry—Kamakura is set to officially open its doors at Mid Valley Megamall on 14 March 2025 and Pavilion Kuala Lumpur on 29 March 2025. Guests will soon be able to enjoy the full range of its signature Warabimochi creations, including seasonal specials and exclusive offerings, at these two locations.

We are thrilled to introduce Kamakura’s exceptional Warabimochi to Malaysia.

export,Can South Africa Deepen Agricultural Exports to China?,1.73769E+12,Wandile Sihlobo,https://wandilesihlobo.com/2025/01/24/can-south-africa-deepen-agricultural-exports-to-china/,https://news.google.com/read/CBMilwFBVV95cUxNWFN6RXRTdnhQdEJqWVNSLWhKbnUtOUFwNVpxWlJTTk9nSEpIa1JLS0l3eHR3cEE1aVB4N3J1UUZmbndyRnBqZDBFa2NkWjdvdXkxQjRLTHJCS2gtNVBDcGhZT3ZFLUN2eEEtcnBEdmw1U3c0aElrZEJRYXRwd2VvZXRSUUFYWXZ0UkFyLUhiWVRVWGdGTkpB?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://wandilesihlobo.com/2025/01/24/can-south-africa-deepen-agricultural-exports-to-china/,"A friend recently sent me a Bloomberg article about China’s efforts to diversify agricultural imports. The idea is to lessen the reliance on the US in anticipation of trade friction under the Trump administration.

Central and South Americans seem to be on the way to becoming the major winners. They have a surplus of agricultural products that China imports, such as grains, oilseeds, red meat, wine, and nuts. The African continent has not benefitted much.

I have recently discussed President Trump’s trade policy’s possible impact on agriculture and how China retaliated against his administration’s tariffs in 2018. The Chinese retaliation hurt the US soybean, maize, and pork farmers at the time.

What we can expect in the coming months will depend on whether President Trump proceeds with the higher tariffs on China, he promised in his recent speeches.

What is clear now is that South America, like in 2018, may be amongst the winners as China searches for new sources of agricultural products.

South Africa’s standing

However, South Africa should also position itself among the key suppliers of agricultural products to China in addition to its current export activity.

I sometimes doubt if South Africans appreciate enough how big China is in global agricultural trade; thus, we keep discussing it. China is a dominant player in the export and import of agricultural products.

In 2023, China was a leading agricultural importer, accounting for 11% of global agricultural imports, which totalled over US$200 billion. The US, Germany, the Netherlands, the UK, France, and Japan trailed China.

Similarly, China played a notable role in exports. In 2023, it was the fifth-largest agricultural exporter in the world. The leading countries ahead of China were the US, Brazil, the Netherlands, and Germany.

Few African countries benefit from these imports due to low agricultural productivity in Africa. Most don’t have volumes to export.

The leading suppliers of agricultural products to China are Brazil, the US, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Canada, Vietnam, France, Russia, Argentina, Chile, Ukraine, the Netherlands, and Malaysia.

The only African country in China’s top 30 agricultural suppliers is South Africa, which ranked 28 in 2023. Still, South Africa remains a negligible player in the Chinese agricultural market, accounting for a mere 0.4% (US$979 million) of China’s agricultural imports of US$218 billion in 2023.

Sudan and Zimbabwe are other African agricultural suppliers to China, ranked 33 and 34, respectively.

Given this reality and China’s efforts to diversify its agricultural suppliers, it is key that the South African message in engagements with the Chinese authorities should be more firm and persuasive in promoting agricultural exports.

South Africa has an agricultural surplus each year, exporting about half of its yearly production. In 2023, South Africa’s agricultural exports amounted to a record US$13.2 billion. Indeed, this is nowhere close to the amount of money China spends annually importing agricultural products from the world, a staggering US$218 billion.

China is already one of South Africa’s major agricultural markets for a variety of fruits, wine, red meat, nuts, maize, soybeans, and wool. However, there is room for more ambitious agricultural export efforts.

The South African agricultural sector—organized agriculture and researchers—consistently points out the need to lower import tariffs in China and remove phytosanitary constraints on various products. From now on, this should be a topic of conversation in engagements with Chinese authorities.

outbreak,Inflation in Malaysia expected to rise by up to 2.8% in 2025,1.7377E+12,asianews.network,https://asianews.network/inflation-in-malaysia-expected-to-rise-by-up-to-2-8-in-2025/,https://news.google.com/read/CBMijgFBVV95cUxNSG5YN2I0VGxRRXVNWlVBQVFkTmVfQXZDNjByWnp1Ym5OY2s2a0paMm0xU1FKRDVhejFrRXVlZElrbExTaTNKbjlzTVFfanBkSFhCa25DYVBPMUpVNld4ZUtNaUY5UGRuWHg0eUFaekZ6d3NLVjBobC01aUtRanJpME9NbEw0NjYySW5Rc2F3?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://asianews.network/inflation-in-malaysia-expected-to-rise-by-up-to-2-8-in-2025/,"January 24, 2025

PETALING JAYA – Analysts expect inflation to grow by as much as 2.8% in 2025, on the back of higher taxes and wages, base effects and continued volatility in global commodity prices and foreign-exchange (forex) markets.

MIDF Research estimated full-year inflation to pick up to 2.8%, driven mainly by changes in government policies such as subsidy rationalisation efforts in the middle of this year.

Similarly, Hong Leong Investment Bank projected inflation to rise to 2.7% year-on-year (y-o-y) in 2025, with upward pressure from domestic measures like fuel subsidy cuts, expanded sales and service tax scope, and wage increases.

Inflation moderated to 1.7% in December 2024, lower than expected, with slower increases in the cost of personal care, social protection and miscellaneous goods and services.

The consumer price index (CPI) for December showed a slower expansion compared to 1.9% in November, but still higher than the 1.5% increase in December 2023.

BIMB Securities Research believed that the current downtrend in inflation will be temporary, with gradual increases expected by mid-2025.

It said this shift is anticipated to push the full-year inflation rate to 2.7%, up from 1.8% in 2024, with key contributors including spillover effects from higher taxes and wages, base effects, and volatility in global commodity and forex markets.

“The 2025 inflation trajectory will be shaped by domestic policy adjustments and external factors.

“Notable domestic drivers include the mid-year retargeting of RON95 subsidies, February’s minimum wage hike, a sales tax revision and the expansion of the services tax scope in May, all of which are expected to raise operating costs and consumer prices,” BIMB Securities Research stated.

The research house added that external risks, such as fluctuations in global commodity markets, currency volatility and potential shifts in US policies, could amplify inflationary pressures.

“Additionally, global uncertainties loom large. Resurgent trade war concerns, following recent comments by US President Donald Trump on potential tariffs against Canada and Mexico, along with sanctions on Russia disrupting oil and tanker markets, have already bolstered oil prices.

“These developments underscore the need to closely monitor global dynamics, as they may significantly affect Malaysia’s inflation outlook and compound commodity price volatility,” it stressed.

Separately, MIDF Research said re-acceleration of inflation in other economies remains a key concern.

“In some countries, the inflation re-accelerated last month, causing a shift in the expectation on the pace of rate cuts by major central banks.

“In the United States, the headline inflation rose to 2.9% y-o-y in December 2024; meanwhile, core CPI slightly moderated to 3.2% y-o-y, indicating an easing of the underlying price pressure,” it noted.

Similarly, the research house said headline inflation in Europe accelerated to 2.4% y-o-y last month, while core inflation remained stable at 2.7% y-o-y.

“In Asia, China’s deflationary risk remained amid concerns over weak demand as the country’s headline CPI inflation eased further to 0.1% y-o-y.

“Meanwhile, other regional economies experienced a slight pickup in their CPI inflation, which are Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines.”

With inflation remaining rather moderate than in previous years, MIDF Research continued to expect central banks’ monetary policy to be on an easing bias.",1.73775E+12,en,-0.280162454,2025-01-24 05:44:23,"['following', 'philippine', 'donald', 'cut', 'slight', 'china', 'outlook', 'midf', 'including', 'policy', 'disrupting', 'bank', 'central', 'expectation', 'adjustment', 'november', 'market', 'trade', 'security', 'include', 'downtrend', 'compound', 'bias', 'social', 'yoy', 'uncertainty', 'expected', 'driver', 'closely', 'pressure', 'minimum', 'care', 'separately', 'rationalisation', 'midyear', 'investment', 'already', 'index', 'domestic', 'last', 'cpi', 'tanker', 'month', 'weak', 'remaining', 'fluctuation', 'january', 'year', 'change', 'hike', 'grow', 'oil', 'underscore', 'analyst', 'sanction', 'yearonyear', 'driven', 'forex', 'may', 'added', 'reaccelerated', 'current', 'bimb', 'asia', 'could', 'trump', 'significantly', 'stressed', 'inflationary', 'comment', 'increase', 'volatility', 'middle', 'projected', 'expanded', 'thailand', 'pace', 'good', 'europe', 'key', 'remained', 'affect', 'inflation', 'remains', 'regional', 'trajectory', 'push', 'stable', 'resurgent', 'temporary', 'deflationary', 'protection', 'united', 'miscellaneous', 'potential', 'operating', 'major', 'retargeting', 'state', 'factor', 'rise', 'similarly', 'estimated', 'petaling', 'meanwhile', 'underlying', 'wage', 'loom', 'external', 'scope', 'expansion', 'upward', 'slower', 'december', 'previous', 'pickup', 'rather', 'lower', 'accelerated', 'base', 'core', 'tariff', 'commodity', 'raise', 'noted', 'development', 'causing', 'canada', 'effort', 'house', 'jaya', 'demand', 'cost', 'anticipated', 'global', 'measure', 'tax', 'service', 'monetary', 'higher', 'price', 'need', 'mid', 'country', 'war', 'revision', 'amid', 'dynamic', 'easing', 'mainly', 'rose', 'research', 'effect', 'expect', 'russia', 'additionally', 'headline', 'moderated', 'ron', 'stated', 'personal', 'amplify', 'large', 'slightly', 'bolstered', 'hong', 'compared', 'recent', 'spillover', 'concern', 'monitor', 'believed', 'reacceleration', 'experienced', 'government', 'gradual', 'economy', 'february', 'rate', 'fullyear', 'showed', 'much', 'subsidy', 'currency', 'still', 'fuel', 'eased', 'back', 'notable', 'sale', 'malaysia', 'indonesia', 'said', 'president', 'contributor', 'mexico', 'risk', 'pick', 'along', 'leong', 'shift', 'consumer', 'foreignexchange', 'continued', 'shaped', 'indicating', 'like', 'moderate']",Neutral

Environment Cabinet Secretary Aden Duale has said that employees of the defunct Kenya Water Towers Agency (KWTA) would be redeployed to various government agencies based on their skills and competencies.

Speaking to former KWTA employees during a meeting at the Kenya Meteorological Department headquarters in Nairobi on Wednesday, Duale assured the workers that their placement would be done in a fair and structured manner.

He was accompanied by Principal Secretaries Gitonga Mugambi (Forestry) and Festus Ng'eno (Environment and Climate Change).

Duale announced that 68 employees would be redeployed to the Environment and Climate Change State Department, while 45 others would join the Forestry State Department.

The ministry considered several factors when finalising the placement list, including qualifications, rank, experience, and disability, as well as the staff's current duty stations.

""I urge you all to continue adhering to the public service code of conduct and the principles of good governance as you transition into your new roles,"" Duale told the former staff members, emphasising the importance of professionalism and integrity.

Expired legal mandate

The dissolution of KWTA in December 2024 followed the expiration of its legal mandate and a Cabinet-approved rationalisation of state corporations with overlapping functions.

The KWTA, which was established through Legal Notice No. 27 in 2012, had a mandate to oversee the conservation, rehabilitation, and sustainable management of Kenya's water towers.

However, its role often overlapped with agencies such as the Kenya Forest Service (KFS), Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI), and the National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA), leading to inefficiencies.

The KWTA disbanded its board and reassigned its chairperson and directors to other government positions as part of the dissolution process.

Duale then directed the principal secretaries for Environment and Climate Change and Forestry to expedite the ongoing audit of KWTA's assets, liabilities, and staff complement.

The restructuring was positively received by stakeholders in the environment sector, who see it as a step toward more effective service delivery and improved governance in managing the country's natural resources.

Duale reiterated that the dissolution of KWTA was part of efforts to enhance efficiency and ensure better management of public resources.

The redistribution of resources and personnel from KWTA to existing agencies like KFS, KEFRI, and NEMA is expected to improve coordination and strengthen these agencies' ability to manage Kenya's natural resources.",1.73774E+12,en,0.116452336,2025-01-23 12:26:54,"['tower', 'meeting', 'staff', 'liability', 'sector', 'reassigned', 'manage', 'overlapping', 'rank', 'duale', 'secretary', 'forestry', 'including', 'directed', 'festus', 'join', 'kwtas', 'complement', 'continue', 'conservation', 'step', 'station', 'existing', 'board', 'expected', 'restructuring', 'integrity', 'enhance', 'worker', 'kwta', 'rationalisation', 'chairperson', 'director', 'aden', 'others', 'change', 'manner', 'often', 'competency', 'member', 'current', 'nairobi', 'structured', 'principle', 'employee', 'placement', 'like', 'notice', 'transition', 'based', 'good', 'improve', 'duty', 'redeployed', 'management', 'considered', 'ngeno', 'function', 'adhering', 'experience', 'defunct', 'wednesday', 'stakeholder', 'asset', 'emphasising', 'kefri', 'dissolution', 'state', 'ministry', 'factor', 'professionalism', 'institute', 'assured', 'personnel', 'announced', 'delivery', 'managing', 'principal', 'well', 'position', 'role', 'fair', 'december', 'natural', 'see', 'meteorological', 'however', 'kfs', 'kenya', 'mandate', 'improved', 'agency', 'urge', 'qualification', 'effective', 'water', 'effort', 'positively', 'environmental', 'leading', 'authority', 'service', 'done', 'legal', 'cabinet', 'list', 'reiterated', 'country', 'strengthen', 'redistribution', 'ability', 'ensure', 'research', 'toward', 'oversee', 'headquarters', 'gitonga', 'climate', 'cabinetapproved', 'rehabilitation', 'national', 'expedite', 'audit', 'accompanied', 'efficiency', 'would', 'former', 'overlapped', 'received', 'speaking', 'public', 'disbanded', 'part', 'government', 'ongoing', 'coordination', 'followed', 'environment', 'importance', 'skill', 'disability', 'expiration', 'forest', 'inefficiency', 'corporation', 'conduct', 'various', 'department', 'several', 'said', 'governance', 'finalising', 'established', 'expired', 'sustainable', 'new', 'process', 'mugambi', 'told', 'nema', 'resource', 'better', 'code']",Neutral

enhancing the competitiveness of micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to meet international halal standards; and facilitating the marketing of halal MSMEs in Indonesia and abroad.The minister noted that Australia ranks as the 18th largest destination for Indonesian halal product exports.During the 2019-2023 period, Indonesian halal product exports to Australia grew by 7.15 percent, reaching US$515.27 million in 2023.""We estimate the Australian halal product market will continue to expand by 6.1 percent for the next 10 years, with a projected value reaching US$26 billion in 2034,"" the minister remarked.He also highlighted that global demand for halal products is on an upward trajectory, with a growth rate of 9.13 percent and a projected world import value reaching US$591.96 billion by 2034.Santoso stated that the government has encouraged the export of Indonesian halal products by providing halal certification for cosmetic products and related ingredients for small and medium enterprises.Other initiatives include facilitation at various cosmetic and food and beverage products (F&B) exhibitions.Moreover, the government has promoted various halal cosmetic products, halal F&B, and fashion at various international exhibitions, such as Beautyworld Middle East Dubai, Beautyworld Saudi Arabia, Malaysia International Halal Showcase, Manila Food & Beverage Expo, ISM Middle East Dubai, Foodex Japan, and China International Import Expo.GAHC is one of the Overseas Halal Institutions (LHLN) based in Australia that is dedicated to fostering the global halal industry's growth and supporting the activities of the Indonesian diaspora in Australia.GAHC has been accredited in Indonesia through the Halal Product Guarantee Agency (BPJPH) and in Australia through the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF).GAHC serves a wide range of industries, including abattoirs, food companies, raw materials, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and logistics processing.",1.73776E+12,en,0.49191922,2025-01-24 08:32:29,"['robust', 'minister', 'supporting', 'meeting', 'indonesian', 'fishery', 'china', 'bpjph', 'rank', 'including', 'forestry', 'period', 'import', 'cooperation', 'australiagahc', 'addition', 'threepronged', 'export', 'australia', 'continue', 'market', 'trade', 'edgein', 'include', 'foodex', 'committed', 'agriculture', 'largest', 'enhance', 'showcase', 'micro', 'dedicated', 'logistics', 'food', 'material', 'guarantee', 'certification', 'santoso', 'world', 'year', 'boost', 'estimate', 'saudi', 'ism', 'value', 'halal', 'reaching', 'facilitating', 'emphasizing', 'enterprise', 'international', 'manila', 'promoted', 'opportunity', 'middle', 'projected', 'range', 'also', 'fridayduring', 'based', 'enhancing', 'overseas', 'discussing', 'trajectory', 'australian', 'grew', 'budi', 'antara', 'facilitation', 'wide', 'marketing', 'highlighted', 'one', 'medium', 'ministry', 'related', 'accredited', 'gahctrade', 'remarkedhe', 'encouraged', 'upward', 'providing', 'improving', 'beverage', 'competitive', 'ingredient', 'standard', 'raw', 'product', 'statement', 'serf', 'agency', 'noted', 'japan', 'diaspora', 'effort', 'lhln', 'demand', 'million', 'global', 'fostering', 'need', 'encompasses', 'beautyworld', 'msmes', 'strengthen', 'jakarta', 'access', 'cosmetic', 'daffgahc', 'activity', 'expo', 'strategy', 'pharmaceutical', 'company', 'approach', 'office', 'stated', 'growth', 'fashion', 'expand', 'meet', 'institution', 'discussed', 'east', 'arabia', 'encourage', 'part', 'competitiveness', 'outlined', 'government', 'abattoir', 'enterprisesother', 'rate', 'percent', 'abroadthe', 'processing', 'next', 'exhibitionsmoreover', 'initiative', 'indonesia', 'expogahc', 'various', 'industry', 'department', 'malaysia', 'exportsduring', 'exhibition', 'billion', 'marketthis', 'small', 'destination', 'dubai']",Neutral

Recently, climate change has significantly impacted global agriculture, particularly affecting fruit cultivation. Following a challenging harvest in 2023, Europe’s apple production faces its second-lowest level of the century, primarily due to severe frost conditions in Eastern Europe, which results in a total yield of just 10.2 million tons—a decline of 1.3 million tons compared to the previous year. In contrast, France’s total apple production in 2024 remains relatively stable, at 1.4 million tons (figures finalized in November 2024). This reflects a slight decrease from 2023 but represents a stable crop compared to the three-year average, showcasing the resilience of French apple cultivation.

The outlook for specific apple varieties varies widely. While the yield of some of the major French varieties such as Golden and Gala has increased —by 8% for Golden and 1% for Gala— other varieties, such as Granny Smith and Fuji, have declined by 26-30%. The production of club varieties and local selections has also decreased this year. For instance, Pink Lady, France’s third-largest variety, yielded 154,000 tons, indicating a 10% decline. Meanwhile, the crop of Jazz has decreased by 19%.

For more than 25 years, French apple growers have proactively embraced innovative and adaptive measures. They are implementing sustainable agricultural practices such as precision irrigation, soil management, and environmentally friendly pest control to ensure the healthy growth of the trees and enhance their resilience. These methods not only protect the environment but also secure a sustainable supply of high-quality apples. Each apple not only tastes delicious but also embodies this commitment.

To introduce the authenticity of its produce and its process of responsible farming, INTERFEL hosted a series of annual activities in Malaysia. The series of activities include French Apple Kombucha Workshop for influencers, consumer roadshow, and in-store samplings at major retail stores such as AEON, Lotus, Econsave, and Jaya Gorcer. The activities happened from December 2024 until March 2025 with great success.

With emphasis on sustainability, Interfel aims to expand their initiative by promoting diverse methods of consuming French Apples and supporting sustainability through various activities that offer versatile uses for French Apples, promoting health, and minimizing the environmental footprint—all while celebrating the varied culinary possibilities of this nutritious fruit.

These activities were a resounding success, drawing the participation of 20 local influencers in the French Apple Kombucha Workshop and reaching over thousands of consumers through in-store samplings. Consumers also enjoyed lively roadshow events featuring fun games and exciting prizes, making the experience both memorable and interactive. French apples are still in season and available at major Malaysian supermarkets until March 2025.

Investment, Trade and Industry Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz said discussions on the DEFA had made positive progress.

""We should be on track. What was agreed upon today is to ensure we conclude it this year, and for Asean members to be more flexible in their approach,"" he said at a press conference after chairing the 31st Asean Economic Ministers Retreat in Desaru on Friday.

Zafrul said the economic ministers had expressed confidence about the importance of the DEFA to provide the necessary impetus to spur Asean digital transformation.

“We know the immense benefits of the DEFA, particularly for Asean micro, small, and medium enterprises and Asean member states,” he said.

The minister also noted that the bloc’s members expect the signing of an upgraded Asean Trade in Goods Agreement during the year-end 47th Asean Summit.

Zafrul said the ministers also had a productive discussion on Asean’s economic relations with external partners.

These include having Asean’s second Summit with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) at the Asean Summit in May, and convening the inaugural Asean-GCC-China Summit on the sidelines of the same event.

“This is seen as a good way of engaging Asean’s external partners, by forging new collaborations that will be able to open up new opportunities in driving our economy,” he said.

Furthermore, Zafrul added that the retreat discussed the status of a few remaining issues under the Asean-China Free Trade Agreement 3.0 negotiations.

“This was followed by the announcement of substantial conclusion by Asean leaders last year. We are optimistic that we will be able to sign the upgraded protocol later this year as one of the priority economic deliverables (PEDs) for our Asean chairmanship,” he said.

Zafrul said that Malaysia, as the country coordinator for India as well as the Asean co-chair for the Asean-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) review, had updated the Asean economic ministers on the progress of negotiations.

“As one of the PEDs for 2025, the AITIGA is set for a substantial conclusion this year,” he said.

Furthermore, as Timor-Leste’s accession is a priority for Malaysia’s chairmanship in 2025, Zafrul said Malaysia strongly views that with its entry as the full 11th member state of Asean, the regional potential and economic growth can be further strengthened.

– A small party in Malaysia’s governing coalition, which has the huge task of corralling Malay-Muslim voters, is facing an uphill climb to maintain its relevance in the country’s crowded political field.

Parti Amanah Negara, with just eight seats in Parliament, is a moderate Islamic party within Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim’s Pakatan Harapan (PH) alliance.

But Amanah’s voice is hardly heard in the rowdy tumble of Malaysian politics, where hot issues over race and religion are regularly played up to megaphone levels.

Formed in 2015 by dissidents of conservative Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS), Amanah has continued to take a middle-of-the-road stance on Islamic and sensitive Malay issues, which has failed to excite the Malay electorate.

“After 10 years in operation and being part of the federal government twice, Amanah’s performance has been quite static,” Dr Mohd Yusri Ibrahim, a policy studies lecturer at Universiti Malaysia Terengganu, told The Straits Times.

He said many Malay-Muslim voters are more drawn to parties that emphasise strong support for Islam and the special privileges of Malays. Amanah has tried to move forward by touting a progressive Islamic agenda, but this “has failed to gain the support of Muslims”, he added.

The party will hold its three-day annual convention from Jan 24 to 26 in Klang city, central Selangor state, where it hopes to refocus the energy of its 250,000 members.

“Faced with increasingly dynamic political challenges, Amanah needs to gear up from every angle,” Amanah’s vice-president and the country’s Health Minister, Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad, said on Facebook on Jan 22.

Malay-Muslims, who represent some 60 per cent of Malaysian voters, have largely remained with the two main Malay-Muslim opposition parties, PAS and Malay-based Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia, as seen in the results of the August 2023 elections involving six states – of which the PH alliance and its unity government ally Barisan Nasional (BN) won three.

PH needs to draw more support from Malay voters after getting just around 33 per cent of total votes from the community in the November 2022 General Election. This compared with about 54 per cent of Malay votes amassed by the alliance led by PAS and Bersatu then.

Indeed, when yet another sensitive issue on Islam or Malays is hotly debated, Umno – another member of Datuk Seri Anwar’s multi-coalition government – would be the one often appearing at the forefront, casting harsh words at Malaysia’s ethnic minorities.

Amanah has two Cabinet ministers in the Anwar government: party president Mohamad Sabu, who is Minister of Agriculture and Food Security, and Dr Dzulkefly. The party also has two deputy ministers and three senators.

Part of the challenge faced by Amanah is the size, history and influence of its political nemesis.

Its rival PAS has 43 federal lawmakers, the biggest number held by a single party in Parliament, and a membership of one million.

The Islamist opposition party, formed six years before the country’s 1957 independence, also controls four state assemblies in Malaysia, including its stronghold states of Kelantan and Terengganu. PAS has a total of 150 state assemblymen, compared with Amanah’s 11.

Still, Amanah’s youth wing chief, Senator Hasbie Muda, believes the party’s hard work on the ground has resulted in an uptick in support over nearly a decade.

“Amanah is increasingly accepted, especially in the opposition stronghold states,” Mr Hasbie told ST. PAS also controls the other two Malay-belt states, Kedah and Perlis.

There is time to catch up as the next general election is due only in early 2028, but Amanah needs to shore up ground support before then, experts say.

“Amanah programmes are getting more response now compared with when the party was first set up (in 2015),” Mr Hasbie said , adding that the party aims to boost the service record of its lawmakers and government workers.

Dr Yusri said his own studies on the ground showed that Amanah’s popularity among Malay-Muslims had never exceeded 5 per cent out of respondents surveyed.

Much of its support comes from the urban, mixed-demographic areas, and from the backing of larger PH coalition parties – the Chinese-led Democratic Action Party and Mr Anwar’s Parti Keadilan Rakyat.

In a recent comment on Amanah’s Facebook page, a disgruntled poster wrote: “The youth wing is weak and directionless... Afraid to speak out when Islam is being trampled on.”

But Dr Yusri said Amanah need not make knee-jerk responses to every controversial issue that hits the headlines, the latest being whether chicken ham sandwiches sold at a convenience store in a Kuala Lumpur university were halal or not.

“They do not need to take the easy road of creating drama over simple issues that can be resolved by the administration. But they need to be smarter in positioning themselves in important and real issues that are involved with empowering the Malays and Islam,” he added.

Credit: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.

Malaysia’s state-run oil company, Petronas, has completed the official transfer of its operatorship for the Kebabangan Cluster production sharing contract (KBBC PSC) in Sabah, Malaysia, to ConocoPhillips Sabah Gas.

This move positions ConocoPhillips Sabah Gas, a subsidiary of US energy giant ConocoPhillips, as the sole operator of the KBBC PSC.

The strategic development, orchestrated by Malaysia Petroleum Management (MPM), is expected to ensure the economic viability of future gas field developments and support the energy security of Sabah.

The KBBC PSC, which comprises a cluster of oil and gas fields, was previously managed by Kebabangan Petroleum Operating Company, a joint operation including Petronas Carigali, Shell Energy Asia and ConocoPhillips Sabah Gas.

Chief Minister of Sabah Datuk Seri Panglima Haji Hajiji said: “Sabah is rapidly emerging as a preferred destination for oil and gas investments, thanks to the strategic developments and partnerships championed by PETRONAS and its industry collaborators.

“These initiatives underscore the vast potential of Sabah’s resources and reinforce our commitment to driving economic growth and creating opportunities for our people. We look forward to further collaboration with PETRONAS in the best interest of Sabah.”

The Kebabangan Cluster has a gas export capacity of up to 750 million standard cubic feet per day (mscf/d).

With the PSC now extended until the end of 2050, commercial agreements have been designed to make upcoming gas field developments in the cluster more economically attractive.

MPM senior vice-president Datuk Ir. Bacho said, “We thank the Sabah State Government for their support in fostering a conducive environment for oil and gas investments. This collaboration reflects our shared commitment to realising business growth and enhancing energy security.

“We are also pleased to welcome ConocoPhillips’ expanded role in Malaysia’s upstream sector, which underscores the continued confidence in the nation’s energy potential.”

Food waste has become an escalating global issue, increasing at a pace that existing solutions struggle to keep up with. As landfills overflow and resources are squandered, the urgency for innovative and sustainable waste management solutions has never been greater. Malaysian startup, Entomal Biotech Sdn Bhd, has turned to an unconventional yet highly effective solution: Hermetia illucens, otherwise known as the black soldier fly (BSF). Co-founder and Chief Commercial Officer Yanni Ching shares insights about Entomal's innovative approach to creating a more sustainable future.

BSF: Nature's waste management experts

Entomal relies on the remarkable abilities of BSF to convert organic material into resources. ""Black soldier flies originated in the Americas but can now be found worldwide since World War II,"" Ching explains. ""Its larvae are remarkably efficient at consuming decaying matter—just a spoonful can process one ton of waste.""

As the larvae grow, they serve dual purposes: they turn into a high-protein feed for animals, and their excretion becomes a nutrient-rich fertilizer. While insect farming is not new, Entomal is leveraging nature's power in sustainable food waste management.

""Entomal takes a more comprehensive approach where we harness the power of BSF to create solutions,"" Ching says. ""In addition to producing fertilizers, we developed multiple protein-rich animal feeds that are highly nutritious and compatible with conventional feed prices. We're also exploring their potential as a human protein source for the future.""

By optimizing BSF's capabilities, Entomal has created a model that not only reduces waste but also generates both economic and environmental benefits.

Entomal's holistic approach addresses waste on multiple levels, offering solutions that extend beyond traditional recycling. Their circular economy model benefits businesses, communities, and ecosystems. ""Hotels can convert kitchen waste into fertilizer or animal feed, generating additional revenue streams,"" Ching explains. Universities integrate BSF into their educational programs, using it to research sustainable practices. Theme parks have even adopted BSF larvae as feed for animals in their petting zoos.

""Here we see how our circular economy model is not just benefiting us as a business but creating benefits across different kinds of communities too,"" Ching says. By turning food waste into a resource, Entomal empowers businesses to turn challenges into opportunities. Their solutions not only help the environment but also provide financial incentives, encouraging wider adoption.

Reducing carbon emissions

Entomal's work does not just tackle food waste; it also addresses carbon emissions, a key contributor to climate change. Traditional waste disposal methods, such as landfills and incineration, release significant amounts of greenhouse gases. By contrast, BSF-based waste management eliminates the need for energy-intensive processes. ""We are unlocking a waste management solution that can significantly reduce carbon emission,"" Ching explains.

Entomal has treated over 22.5 tons of food waste to date, preventing roughly 55 tons of carbon emissions. But the company has its sights set on scaling up. ""Our central plant is set to treat 5 tons of waste per day, but we are working to increase that to 30 tons. Eventually, by scaling up our central plant, we want to treat 2,000 tons daily, preventing 5,000 tons of carbon emissions each day,"" she says.

Technology plays a crucial role in Entomal's efforts. ""These tools allow clients to track their carbon footprint and measure the impact of their sustainability efforts,"" Ching explains. Entomal is also exploring advanced technologies such as blockchain, Web3, and IoT sensors. ""In the future, we hope to translate this data into carbon tokens or credits, adding even more value to the process,"" she adds.

Entomal's innovative solutions caught the attention of Japanese businesses and government officials during the SusHi Tech Challenge 2024 pitch contest. SusHi Tech Tokyo, short for Sustainable High City Tech Tokyo, is a Tokyo-based concept that aims to create sustainable new value by overcoming global urban challenges through cutting-edge technology, diverse ideas, and digital expertise. The company emerged as a finalist and was awarded the prestigious Special Prizes by the Global Digital Innovation Network and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.

""We never really thought about expanding to Japan, but the experience at SusHi Tech Tokyo 2024 was fabulous,"" Ching recalls. ""Japan is so welcoming and supportive when it comes to international solutions. The support we received made the process smooth and we feel that the door is open for us to come in anytime.""

With Japan's BSF market still in its early stages, Entomal is actively seeking local partners to bring their technology to Japan.

What's next for Entomal?

Entomal's ambitions go far beyond their home country of Malaysia. The company envisions a global ecosystem where waste is no longer discarded but repurposed into something valuable. But achieving this vision requires collaboration.

""Combined with our production of animal feed and fertilizers, we aim to empower agriculture not just in Malaysia but globally, strengthening food security for humanity,"" Ching explains. ""We hope to create a collaborative ecosystem that involves governments, corporations, academia, and policymakers so that we are not making these efforts alone.""

The road to sustainability, however, is not without its obstacles. Waste management is an often-overlooked industry that comes with physical and logistical challenges. But Ching believes the rewards outweigh the difficulties. ""Food waste management is a tough industry to be in. It's dirty, dangerous, and difficult,"" she says. ""But through our work, we hope to tackle these challenges while empowering and inspiring the next generation to be the change they wish to see in the world.""

Entomal's work demonstrates the power of innovation and determination in addressing global challenges. By transforming waste into resources, the company is not only solving today's problems but also laying the groundwork for a more sustainable tomorrow. Ching concludes, ""Change won't happen unless we take action today.""",1.74079E+12,en,0.573915064,2025-02-28 11:20:00,"['beyond', 'highprotein', 'consuming', 'explains', 'illucens', 'early', 'awarded', 'scaling', 'highly', 'road', 'sustainability', 'amount', 'central', 'fertilizer', 'story', 'convert', 'yet', 'market', 'producing', 'globally', 'diverse', 'far', 'greenhouse', 'material', 'remarkably', 'world', 'bring', 'vision', 'value', 'longer', 'integrate', 'strengthening', 'wont', 'malaysian', 'squandered', 'bsfs', 'escalating', 'belief', 'wider', 'power', 'increase', 'additional', 'pace', 'become', 'tomorrow', 'different', 'experience', 'encouraging', 'seeking', 'potential', 'combined', 'significant', 'impact', 'otherwise', 'reduces', 'issue', 'sensor', 'obstacle', 'yanni', 'laying', 'provide', 'never', 'biotech', 'hermetia', 'tech', 'nutritious', 'known', 'effective', 'effort', 'transforming', 'ambition', 'happen', 'country', 'commercial', 'wish', 'research', 'digital', 'urgency', 'made', 'expert', 'solution', 'partner', 'cuttingedge', 'aim', 'empower', 'decaying', 'day', 'offering', 'take', 'next', 'hotel', 'adopted', 'industry', 'malaysia', 'concept', 'contributor', 'token', 'prize', 'even', 'turning', 'startup', 'unless', 'stage', 'turned', 'across', 'soldier', 'ching', 'high', 'generation', 'nature', 'comprehensive', 'struggle', 'track', 'addition', 'program', 'tool', 'urban', 'security', 'existing', 'capability', 'becomes', 'collaboration', 'conventional', 'waste', 'insect', 'educational', 'source', 'grow', 'requires', 'network', 'translate', 'idea', 'international', 'opportunity', 'matterjust', 'economic', 'anytime', 'increasing', 'dangerous', 'key', 'farming', 'feel', 'business', 'alone', 'entomals', 'model', 'revenue', 'challenge', 'footprint', 'groundwork', 'harness', 'date', 'advanced', 'caught', 'outweigh', 'purpose', 'zoo', 'compatible', 'recall', 'bhd', 'physical', 'global', 'benefiting', 'door', 'war', 'ability', 'organic', 'valuable', 'energyintensive', 'release', 'spoonful', 'contest', 'black', 'approach', 'innovative', 'help', 'add', 'want', 'government', 'efficient', 'practice', 'local', 'sight', 'data', 'still', 'corporation', 'client', 'leveraging', 'eliminates', 'resource', 'promoting', 'nutrientrich', 'carbon', 'developed', 'repurposed', 'treat', 'say', 'solving', 'tough', 'empowering', 'crucial', 'gas', 'sushi', 'agriculture', 'metropolitan', 'empowers', 'kind', 'akiyoshi', 'expertise', 'plant', 'daily', 'change', 'holistic', 'supportive', 'hope', 'park', 'come', 'serve', 'university', 'whats', 'tokyobased', 'address', 'greater', 'thought', 'working', 'prestigious', 'one', 'today', 'discarded', 'benefit', 'oftenoverlooked', 'fabulous', 'generates', 'set', 'blockchain', 'landfill', 'animal', 'technology', 'open', 'role', 'remarkable', 'fly', 'worldwide', 'however', 'future', 'eventually', 'something', 'core', 'play', 'city', 'financial', 'support', 'traditional', 'japan', 'emission', 'adoption', 'actively', 'keep', 'measure', 'adding', 'need', 'price', 'circular', 'create', 'action', 'turn', 'method', 'multiple', 'proteinrich', 'yoko', 'ecosystem', 'academia', 'climate', 'attention', 'humanity', 'community', 'recycling', 'roughly', 'inspiring', 'allow', 'america', 'economy', 'pitch', 'overcoming', 'japanese', 'update', 'environment', 'envisions', 'home', 'level', 'making', 'new', 'process', 'using', 'difficulty', 'demonstrates', 'per', 'preventing', 'logistical', 'extend', 'work', 'found', 'insight', 'reward', 'larva', 'overflow', 'created', 'sdn', 'tackle', 'dual', 'credit', 'petting', 'officer', 'courtesy', 'smooth', 'kitchen', 'food', 'unlocking', 'difficult', 'significantly', 'also', 'since', 'official', 'edited', 'management', 'stream', 'finalist', 'production', 'concludes', 'special', 'involves', 'policymakers', 'treated', 'expanding', 'protein', 'exclusively', 'incentive', 'dirty', 'sponsored', 'feed', 'without', 'see', 'addressing', 'really', 'ton', 'disposal', 'unconventional', 'optimizing', 'incineration', 'environmental', 'website', 'exploring', 'relies', 'short', 'creating', 'welcoming', 'innovation', 'web', 'theme', 'originated', 'achieving', 'company', 'entomal', 'human', 'collaborative', 'share', 'received', 'tokyo', 'contrast', 'reduce', 'cofounder', 'generating', 'excretion', 'problem', 'chief', 'iot', 'bsfbased', 'determination', 'reducing', 'sustainable', 'emerged', 'bsf']",Positive

According to the 40-page study Planetary Solvency the populations are already affected by food system shocks, water insecurity, heat stress and infectious diseases. Unchecked climate change will increase the likelihood of two billion deaths, mass displacement, severe economic contraction and conflict.

The study proposes a “planetary solvency” dashboard to provide policymakers with risk information, arguing that action has been slowed by a lack of realistic risk messaging.

It also calls for annual planetary solvency assessments to be carried out by “an appropriate body” such as the International Monetary Fund or OECD. It said systemic risk officers should work at supranational, national and subnational levels to enhance systemic risk management capability.

IFoA council member and lead author of the report Sandy Trust said, “Widely used but deeply flawed assessments of the economic impact of climate change show a negligible impact on GDP, rendering policymakers blind to the immense risk current policy trajectories place us in.”

University of Exter professor and co-author of the report Tim Lenton said, “Current approaches are failing to properly assess escalating planetary risks or help control them. Planetary solvency applies the established approaches of risk professionals to our life-support system and finds it in jeopardy. It offers a clear way of seeing global risks and prioritising action to limit them.”",1.73774E+12,en,-0.546958268,2025-01-24 00:01:58,"['unless', 'lead', 'insecurity', 'work', 'policy', 'supranational', 'systemic', 'failing', 'way', 'say', 'prioritising', 'conflict', 'appropriate', 'jeopardy', 'trust', 'lifesupport', 'capability', 'officer', 'enhance', 'face', 'stress', 'severe', 'coauthor', 'offer', 'already', 'food', 'properly', 'lenton', 'january', 'taken', 'change', 'annual', 'council', 'member', 'immense', 'limit', 'current', 'arguing', 'unchecked', 'could', 'international', 'university', 'escalating', 'increase', 'show', 'economic', 'also', 'likelihood', 'realistic', 'death', 'management', 'immediate', 'call', 'posed', 'trajectory', 'policymakers', 'used', 'tim', 'place', 'loss', 'mass', 'control', 'impact', 'clear', 'subnational', 'two', 'sandy', 'oecd', 'provide', 'slowed', 'professor', 'exter', 'fund', 'rendering', 'joint', 'widely', 'deeply', 'gdp', 'water', 'released', 'displacement', 'infectious', 'global', 'information', 'monetary', 'professional', 'ifoa', 'action', 'assessment', 'body', 'solvency', 'blind', 'climate', 'report', 'disease', 'messaging', 'national', 'flawed', 'approach', 'help', 'contraction', 'carried', 'study', 'according', 'population', 'dashboard', 'applies', 'system', 'shock', 'lack', 'planetary', 'economy', 'find', 'page', 'seeing', 'negligible', 'assess', 'affected', 'heat', 'proposes', 'said', 'level', 'established', 'billion', 'risk', 'author']",Negative

GM Iniyan wins Johor International Open Chess title in Malaysia

Indian Grandmaster Iniyan Panneerselvam clinched the 9th Johor International Open chess tournament title in Malaysia with a dominating performance.

The 22-year-old from Erode in Tamil Nadu accumulated 8.5 points in nine games. He finished 1.5 points ahead of his nearest rival, winning against four International Masters and one Grandmaster.

The nine-round tournament, which ended on Thursday, had 84 participants from eight countries, out of which 24 were titled players.

In fact, at the end of the penultimate round where he beat Indonesian IM Nayaka Budhidharma, Iniyan had already secured the title as he was 1.5 points ahead in the points table.

Iniyan beat Vietnamese GM Nguyen Van Huy in the final round in an impressive performance.

Indian IM VS Raahul and Chinese IM Li Bo finished second and third respectively.

Iniyan, who had won the Chennai Open earlier in January, secured 15 rating points from the title win.

Ghoshal, Shameena emerge WSC Open champs

Saurav Ghoshal and Shameena Riaz, both representing Tamil Nadu, emerged the men’s and women’s champions, respectively, in the four-star Willingdon Sports Club Squash Classic Open 2025, which concluded at the WSC Squash courts.

Ghoshal, the 39-year-old former Indian squash star, retired from international tournaments, dispatched off the top seed Suraj Chand of the Jindal Squash Academy, Vashind 11-3, 11-2, 11-2.

The younger and, probably fitter Chand was never a given a chance by Ghoshal to engage in long rallies as the former ace kept finding the corners with incredible accuracy to close points and finish off the match in short time.

The women’s final, though a bit longer and with its moments, was still a one sided affair between the two unseeded players, with Shamima getting the better of Maharashtra’s Akanksha Gupta 11-7, 11-8, 11-4.

Tamil Nadu players had further success, with Sandesh P R and Shiven Agarwal winning the Boys U-19 and U-17 titles respectively. While Sandesh P R rallied after a shaky start to get the better of UP’s Karan Yadav 5-11, 11-7, 13-11, 11-9, Shiven Agarwal was given a fight for his money by Maharashtra’s Jigar Rambhia. Rambhia, who trains and plays at the Juhu Vile Parle Gymkhana went toe to toe with Agarwal, before losing steam in the decider to go down 11-7, 7-11, 11-9, 6-11, 11-7.

Results (all finals):

Men: Saurav Ghoshal (TN) bt Suraj Chand (Mah) (1) 11-3, 11-2, 11-2

Women: Shamima Riaz (TN) bt Akanksha Gupta (Mah) 11-7, 11-8, 11-4.

Boys U-19: Sandesh P R (TN) bt Karan Yadav (UP) 5-11, 11-7, 13-11, 11-9.

His statement comes after Datuk Shahelmey Yahya confirmed that his Umno membership was still active following checks with the party headquarters, raising the possibility of him contesting under the Barisan Nasional logo in the upcoming state election.

Bung clarified that Shahelmey’s suspension was not due to his support for Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor but for “betraying the party’s struggle and mandate.”

“Umno is a principled party and will not compromise with members who are disloyal to its cause,” Bung said, emphasising that loyalty to Umno requires strict adherence to party policies and decisions.

Datuk Andy Muhammad Suryady Bandy, the Tanjung Batu assemblyman, was also suspended for defying the party’s directive to withdraw support for Hajiji as Chief Minister in January 2023.

While Bung had previously stated that both were suspended, Shahelmey noted that his active membership status contradicted the claim, suggesting that Bung’s statement was the only indication of his suspension.

Bung urged Umno’s Supreme Council to take firm action against disloyal members, stressing that the party does not need leaders who only maintain membership to qualify for election candidacy.

“Umno Sabah is clear – we will not support any leader who has betrayed the party to contest under Umno and Barisan Nasional in the upcoming elections,” he said.

The 65-year-old is the tok batin or spiritual leader of the Mah Meri indigenous community residing on Carey Island in Selangor, Malaysia.

It's a role he had taken on since 2013.

Every year, he leads his community to observe Hari Moyang or Ancestors’ Day.

Mr Daiman said: “If we do not practise this, who else is going to do it? We have to keep it alive for the younger generations.”

This weekend, In Pictures looks at how the indigenous Mah Meri people in Malaysia celebrate an ancient tradition and why the event holds much significance for the community.

AN ANCIENT TRADITION

Ancestors' Day for the Mah Meri community typically occurs after the Chinese New Year.

This year, it fell on Feb 2, a date decided by Mr Daiman based on what his ancestors ""reveal"" to him.

On this day, the Mah Meri people believe that they are visited by the spirits of their ancestors and prepare offerings in the form of food and flowers as a sign of respect.

“Ultimately these cuts will remove food and healthcare from desperate people,” Dodds said in a letter to Starmer posted on X.

Starmer on Tuesday pledged to raise UK defence spending to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2027, but ordered the overseas development budget to be cut from 0.5 percent to 0.3 percent of gross national income to pay for it.

Dodds said while she believed defence spending needed to be increased as “the postwar global order has come crashing down”, she had hoped for a collective discussion on how to pay for it.

“Instead, the tactical decision was taken for ODA to absorb the entire burden,” she said, referring to overseas development assistance.

She voiced fears that plans to support the people of Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan, as well as climate change and vaccination programmes would now fall by the wayside.

“It will be impossible to maintain these priorities given the depth of the cuts,” Dodds warned.

And she said that it would “likely lead to a UK pull-out from numerous African, Caribbean and Western Balkan nations”.

Dodds is the fourth minister to leave Starmer’s cabinet since his Labour party swept to victory in last year’s elections, ending 14 years of Conservative rule.

Earlier this month the UK leader sacked junior health minister, Andrew Gwynne, for making anti-Semitic, racist and sexist remarks in a WhatsApp chat.

In January, anti-corruption minister Tulip Siddiq resigned after being named in probes in Bangladesh into graft accusations.

While expressing respect for the United States’ decision, the Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability Minister said global efforts to tackle climate change must continue.

“That is their decision. The world will continue moving forward to find a way to deal with climate change.

“For us, we will increase our efforts with other countries to build a future that is resilient against climate change,” he told a press conference at the 29th Conference of the Parties (COP29) debrief session yesterday.

“Malaysia will also continue to discuss and protect our relationships with our diplomatic partners, including the United States, regardless.”

The session also saw the launch of Malaysia’s United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Participation Report at COP29, which Nik Nazmi hailed as a resounding success.

During the two-week event, Malaysia’s delegation of 313 members ranked 27th among 195 countries, demonstrating its strong commitment to global climate efforts.

“Over two weeks, the Malaysia Pavilion became a hub of collaboration as we secured three memoranda of understanding and partnerships while hosting 188 international and local speakers in 48 talks and events,” Nik Nazmi said at the event.

He also shared plans to leverage Brazil’s expertise in tropical forest conservation at COP30, which will be held in Brazil in November.

Nik Nazmi also highlighted Malaysia’s successful submission of its Biennial Transparency Report to the UNFCCC on Dec 31, as part of its obligations under the Paris Agreement.

“The report provides a transparent account of Malaysia’s greenhouse gas inventory, mitigation measures, and support needs.

“It is a significant milestone in enhancing our climate governance and fostering trust with the global community while underscoring our dedication to transparency and accountability in climate governance.

“It also reflects Malaysia’s proactive approach to addressing climate challenges while aligning with regional and global commitment,” he said.

The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015 by 196 parties, aims to limit global warming to 1.5°C by the end of this century through reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Malaysia ratified the agreement in November 2016.

After being sworn in to a second term on Monday, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing the United States to again withdraw from the agreement, echoing his decision in 2017.",1.73773E+12,en,0.663784087,2025-01-24 00:54:09,"['minister', 'transparent', 'following', 'underscoring', 'donald', 'mitigation', 'deal', 'obligation', 'sustainability', 'doubling', 'including', 'became', 'monday', 'inventory', 'respect', 'way', 'say', 'build', 'twoweek', 'provides', 'continue', 'conservation', 'demonstrating', 'november', 'gas', 'tackle', 'strong', 'trust', 'decision', 'conference', 'collaboration', 'accountability', 'plan', 'lumpur', 'secured', 'greenhouse', 'expertise', 'directing', 'world', 'shared', 'change', 'withdraw', 'term', 'must', 'member', 'limit', 'ranked', 'held', 'aligning', 'session', 'cop', 'three', 'event', 'participation', 'trump', 'international', 'increase', 'protect', 'unfccc', 'moving', 'also', 'warming', 'enhancing', 'paris', 'leverage', 'regional', 'end', 'highlighted', 'united', 'state', 'regardless', 'saw', 'talk', 'commitment', 'significant', 'party', 'nazmi', 'account', 'framework', 'two', 'challenge', 'speaker', 'partnership', 'hub', 'expressing', 'natural', 'dec', 'addressing', 'withdrawal', 'agreement', 'future', 'relationship', 'diplomatic', 'among', 'resilient', 'ahmad', 'transparency', 'support', 'nation', 'milestone', 'effort', 'emission', 'environmental', 'global', 'measure', 'fostering', 'need', 'biennial', 'dedication', 'country', 'successful', 'sworn', 'convention', 'brazil', 'pic', 'hosting', 'order', 'understanding', 'success', 'climate', 'week', 'report', 'memoranda', 'executive', 'approach', 'community', 'partner', 'proactive', 'century', 'second', 'aim', 'kuala', 'part', 'yesterday', 'echoing', 'find', 'forward', 'local', 'forest', 'submission', 'adopted', 'reflects', 'debrief', 'hailed', 'malaysia', 'delegation', 'said', 'nik', 'governance', 'president', 'reducing', 'resounding', 'discus', 'pavilion', 'launch', 'signed', 'tropical', 'resource', 'told', 'ratified', 'combat', 'press']",Positive

The affected roads are Jalan Jiwa Murni (section from Belaga town leading to Bintulu district) and the road from Belaga town to Long Dungan settlement and the upper reaches beyond Long Dungan, according to reports from the Sarawak Fire and Rescue Department.

These key rural roads link the big population of interior natives in the remote regions of Belaga district to the outside world.

They are the only land routes for the native folks’ daily transportation, food and fuel supplies.

The Belaga Bomba has deployed rescue personnel to the affected locations.

Their ground reports said the roads started cracking up after continuous torrential rain had loosened the hillslopes and triggered landslides.

""These roads have collapsed and are no longer passable to all vehicles.

""The Public Works Department has been informed of these incidents,"" said the department.

These interior roads are the only link for dozens of populated settlements to Belaga town and onwards to Bintulu.

Aside from populated settlements, these roads are the link to government clinics and schools in the upper reaches.

The transportation of crucial daily necessities such as foodstuffs and fuel had been disrupted too.

On March 2, the 26-year-old Singaporean unleashed a roar of relief as she finally ended a 66-month wait for a Badminton World Federation World Tour title.

She took 41 minutes to beat Vietnam’s Nguyen Thuy Linh 21-16, 21-17 in the women’s singles final of the Super 300 German Open for her first World Tour title since the 2019 Hyderabad Open, and the biggest triumph of her career so far.

After picking up a cheque for US$18,000 (S$24,300), she told The Straits Times: “This title means a lot to me. I’ve gone through so many losses and setbacks that this victory becomes even sweeter.

“The struggle has been a long one but I kept believing that I can do it, and I’m grateful for (national singles) coach Kim (Ji-hyun) to guide me along the way.

“She has been helping me to prepare tactically and mentally before every match. Along the way, she’s also making adjustments to help me improve. The results may not be immediate because some changes need a process, but we are working towards it.”

Yeo, who has also relied on self-talk to remind herself to be calmer and more focused, has definitely shown positive signs.

After winning the lower-tier Polish Open in 2023, Yeo beat four top-10 players the following year in South Korea’s An Se-young, Akane Yamaguchi of Japan, China’s Han Yue and Indonesian Gregoria Tunjung, and ended her winless run against India’s 2019 world champion P. V. Sindhu.

The world No. 13 has carried over her fine form to 2025 with quarter-final appearances at the Super 1000 Malaysia Open and Super 750 India Open, before claiming her third World Tour title and fifth international title at the Westenergie Sporthalle in Mulheim.

Yeo made a quick start, stamping her authority with some good disguise and drop shots to take a 9-2 lead. World No. 29 Thuy Linh tried to smash her way back, but was often dragged out of position by crafty shot placements from the Singaporean, who managed to stay at least two points ahead en route to taking the opening game.

The quality and angles of some of Yeo’s shots in the second game left the Vietnamese confounded as she built on an 11-6 lead at the interval to earn five match points before clinching the championship on her third when Thuy Linh dumped a backhand into the net.

The victory has given her the belief to aim for more titles and break into the top 10 for the first time.

The former junior world No. 1 said: “The ability to adapt to any player and any situation is key, and I know I have to be consistent every day in order to win titles.”

Meanwhile, compatriot Loh Kean Yew will also take away positives from the US$240,000 event despite losing 21-19, 21-18 in the men’s singles final against Denmark’s Viktor Axelsen, who extends his head-to-head superiority to 11-2.

The Singaporean world No. 15 raised hopes of an upset when he turned 0-2 and 13-16 deficits into 8-3 and 18-16 leads respectively by being patient yet aggressive, but a clinical Axelsen took the first game.

The two-time Olympic champion and world No. 4 then raced to a 20-10 lead in the second game, and the gap was too big for Loh to surmount despite saving eight match points as he settled for second place and US$9,120 prize money.

Axelsen praised his opponent for being “an amazing player” who played “a good tournament”, while Loh said: “I think I put on quite a good show this week. We know each other’s game quite well so it was a tough battle physically and mentally. It’s always tough and he played a good game, so credit to him.

“I would love to work on myself physically and mentally. I need to rest and recover first. Tomorrow is a travel day and I will start from zero for the (March 4-9) Orleans Masters, a new tournament with new opponents.”

Singapore Badminton Association president Lawrence Leow lauded Yeo and Loh’s efforts, and attributed their success ahead of SG60 to their support team comprising their parents, coaches, teammates and administrators over the years.

Kim said: “Jia Min moved fast today and was attacking at the right moments. However, we have to improve on more variations at the net.

As ASEAN chair for 2025, Malaysia faces mounting pressure to intervene in the imminent deportation of Uyghur refugees from Thailand to China, in what experts call a critical test of the region’s commitment to human rights.

The situation has gained urgency as Thailand appears poised to deport dozens of Uyghur refugees who have been detained for over a decade despite international concerns over China’s treatment of its Uyghur minority.

“Malaysia, as both ASEAN chair and a prominent Muslim-majority nation, has a unique moral authority to address this crisis,” Abdulhakim Idris, Executive Director of the Washington-based thinktank Center for Uyghur Studies (CUS), told TRP in an interview.

The CUS focuses on the issues facing the Uyghur community globally and advocates for the rights of Uyghurs in the diaspora.

Idris, who maintains active dialogue with Malaysian civil society organizations, emphasized that Malaysia’s intervention could be decisive in preventing what he describes as “a potential humanitarian catastrophe.”

Leadership Moment: Malaysia’s Strategic Options

Idris suggests several immediate actions Malaysia could take:

Initiating emergency diplomatic discussions with Thai authorities

Mobilizing ASEAN’s collective response

Engaging international partners for third-country resettlement options

Malaysia’s leadership is vital as ASEAN chair and also as one of the Muslim-majority countries.

By standing up to this injustice, Malaysia will protect not only the future of the Uyghur Muslims but also safeguard the freedoms of generations to come.

If Malaysia makes a statement and asks to halt the deportation and call for the safe resettlement of these Uyghur to a third country, Malaysia’s actions can inspire nations across Asia and beyond to join this critical effort.

Between Principles and Pragmatism

However, Malaysia faces a delicate diplomatic balance.

While advocating for the Uyghurs’ protection, it must deal with a complex relationship with China and Thailand.

Analysts suggest the key is to frame this as a humanitarian rather than a political one.

The situation remains fluid, but observers agree that Malaysia’s next moves could define its leadership role in ASEAN and its standing in the international community.

In the past, ASEAN has faced criticism for its limited intervention regarding Uyghur issues, often remaining silent in the face of their plight.

The organization’s principle of non-interference makes decisive actions challenging.

KOTA KINABALU:

New 47th United States President Donald J. Trump’s global tariff plan may cause inflation, according to Affin Bank Berhad Group Chief Economist Alan Tan.

He said Trump is expected to reinstate policies invalidated by former President Joseph Biden, and might use executive power to impose tariffs, up to 20 per cent tariff on all imports, 60 per cent on Chinese imports and 200 per cent on imported vehicles from Mexico into the United States, etc.

“Trump may demote or replace Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and enact more presidential control over interest rates.

“Trump has already exited the Paris Climate Accords, reverse Biden-era limits on energy projects and eased regulations on cryptocurrency industry.

“Advanced economies have spearheaded global monetary easing cycle.

“While policy uncertainties under the new US administration may introduce some volatility to the Ringgit, the positive domestic economic outlook is expected to bolster its strength,” said Alan.

He opined that Trump may extend 2017 tax cuts, lower corporate tax rate from 21 per cent to 15 per cent, or eliminate federal income tax.

He predicted that private investment growth momentum to remain strong in 2025. Malaysia tourist arrivals are expected to increase in the next two years.

“Global economic outlook for 2025 remains steady. IMF downgraded its projection for China’s real GDP, while Asean 5 is expected to remain steady in 2025.

“External demand is anticipated to recover further with rising global merchandise trade activities, increasing exports of electrical and electronic products, and with further expansion of tourism activities, while domestic demand remains resilience with improving labour market conditions, rising investment activities, and stable household aggregate spending,” Tan said.

“Malaysia’s electrical and electronic exports are expected to rebound in tandem with global semiconductor sales.”

According to Tan, Malaysia’s economic outlook for 2025 is positive, backed by strong growth prospects, stable commodity prices and a resilient as the economy is to grow by 5.2 per cent this year compared with its 5 per cent estimate in 2024.

The bank said the projection is in line with the Finance Ministry’s (MOF) forecast of between 4.5 per cent and 5.5 per cent.

Tan said Malaysia would likely benefit because of the China plus one strategy which involves diversifying its investments and manufacturing operations out of China to other countries.

“We will continue to see trade diversion with exporters, companies in China relocating their plants to Asean like Malaysia to escape tariffs. This could continue.

Therefore, Malaysia should continue to benefit,” he said.

On the ringgit, Tan said the bank sees room for the local note to end 2025 at RM4.10 to the US dollar. It anticipates the US Federal Reserve to continue cutting rates.

As for the overnight policy rate (OPR), it is expected to remain stable, thus narrowing the interest differentials between local rates and the US Fed rate.

“This will bring about some ringgit inflows,” he added.

On the CPO price for 2015, Tan predicts RM4,275 per metric tonne as unpredictable climate change that is expected to have an adverse impact on the global supply of edible oils and hence lifting their prices.

He sees petroleum oil at RM75 per barrel although Trump has instructed Saudi Arabia and OPEC to reduce prices of oil as Trump also intends to increase oil and gas extraction activities in the United States.",1.73798E+12,en,0.367522478,2025-01-26 07:59:58,"['per', 'asean', 'predicted', 'extend', 'donald', 'supply', 'cut', 'intends', 'exited', 'china', 'cpo', 'outlook', 'policy', 'bank', 'exporter', 'berhad', 'spearheaded', 'tourist', 'aggregate', 'import', 'electronic', 'household', 'administration', 'overnight', 'spark', 'real', 'export', 'diversion', 'continue', 'arrival', 'accord', 'imf', 'condition', 'market', 'trade', 'gas', 'unpredictable', 'cent', 'strong', 'dollar', 'projection', 'recover', 'instructed', 'use', 'uncertainty', 'expected', 'tandem', 'backed', 'energy', 'adverse', 'plan', 'tonne', 'diversifying', 'investment', 'already', 'domestic', 'plant', 'fed', 'bring', 'year', 'prospect', 'change', 'grow', 'estimate', 'note', 'oil', 'saudi', 'may', 'added', 'tan', 'limit', 'could', 'advertisement', 'trump', 'kota', 'like', 'increase', 'power', 'extraction', 'volatility', 'economic', 'affin', 'alan', 'also', 'opined', 'increasing', 'paris', 'kinabalu', 'narrowing', 'opec', 'inflation', 'remains', 'stable', 'hence', 'ringgit', 'involves', 'invalidated', 'end', 'spending', 'although', 'united', 'one', 'group', 'room', 'chinese', 'corporate', 'benefit', 'state', 'ministry', 'momentum', 'rising', 'enact', 'labour', 'control', 'impose', 'might', 'differential', 'impact', 'positive', 'bidenera', 'strength', 'edible', 'external', 'expansion', 'chairman', 'two', 'improving', 'sponsored', 'inflow', 'lifting', 'plus', 'advanced', 'see', 'lower', 'forecast', 'private', 'metric', 'product', 'income', 'resilient', 'tariff', 'gdp', 'federal', 'commodity', 'demote', 'powell', 'eliminate', 'demand', 'bolster', 'escape', 'resilience', 'anticipated', 'opr', 'measure', 'global', 'monetary', 'tax', 'electrical', 'manufacturing', 'price', 'joseph', 'semiconductor', 'country', 'barrel', 'reverse', 'economist', 'easing', 'predicts', 'introduce', 'activity', 'petroleum', 'tourism', 'executive', 'climate', 'strategy', 'company', 'presidential', 'growth', 'merchandise', 'interest', 'thus', 'former', 'imported', 'etc', 'remain', 'would', 'expert', 'finance', 'according', 'regulation', 'compared', 'arabia', 'cause', 'anticipates', 'economy', 'downgraded', 'cutting', 'reduce', 'content', 'rate', 'rebound', 'operation', 'cycle', 'vehicle', 'biden', 'next', 'local', 'likely', 'line', 'chief', 'eased', 'therefore', 'industry', 'sale', 'reinstate', 'malaysia', 'president', 'said', 'project', 'mexico', 'jerome', 'mof', 'relocating', 'new', 'replace', 'reserve', 'cryptocurrency', 'steady']",Neutral

As Malaysia advances towards a technology-driven education system, the Fasih Digital initiative under the 2027 curriculum must ensure students are not only skilled in digital tools but also responsible online users. Digital citizenship is essential in fostering data privacy awareness, cybersecurity responsibility, and ethical digital behaviour, reducing risks such as cyberbullying, misinformation, and online fraud. Countries like Singapore, Finland, and Australia have embedded cyber wellness, media literacy, and online safety education into their school curriculums, a model Malaysia can adapt with support from the Ministry of Education (KPM) and the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC).

A key component of digital citizenship is data privacy and cybersecurity awareness, equipping students to identify cyber threats and protect their personal information. Schools should introduce mandatory digital safety modules covering password security, safe browsing, and encryption techniques. Raising awareness about AI and privacy protection is equally important, ensuring students understand how AI tracks digital footprints and collects personal data. MCMC’s Click Wisely initiative is a notable example, educating students on phishing scams, where cybercriminals use disguised links to steal information. Workshops and webinars on phishing awareness teach students to spot fraudulent e-mails, avoid malicious links, and report cyber threats.

Beyond cybersecurity, students must develop ethical and responsible online behaviour. Schools should implement digital etiquette lessons, promoting respectful communication, responsible social media use, and anti-cyberbullying strategies. Media literacy training is vital in helping students verify online information, detect fake news, and recognise manipulated content like deepfake videos. Meanwhile, parent-student awareness programmes can reinforce digital ethics at home through discussions on online safety, screen-time management, and privacy settings.

Ensuring a safe digital learning environment requires effective digital safeguards in schools. This includes age-appropriate internet policies such as content filtering and cybersecurity monitoring systems to block harmful content and prevent access to unsafe websites. A national digital citizenship code of conduct, if jointly developed by MCMC and KPM, would set clear guidelines on responsible online behaviour and digital rights. To make cybersecurity education engaging, schools can introduce gamified cyber awareness challenges, including hacking simulations, cybersecurity competitions, and AI-driven interactive quizzes to instill safe digital habits in students.

As Malaysia moves towards digital transformation in education, ensuring safe, ethical, and responsible online engagement is crucial for Fasih Digital’s success. With comprehensive digital citizenship programmes, strengthened cybersecurity education, and close collaboration between MCMC and KPM, Malaysia can nurture a digitally competent, ethical, and cyber-aware generation, ready to navigate the digital world securely and intelligently.

From 2014 to 2024, the most notable rate of growth in terms of prices was recorded for supplies to Japan (+2.8%), while the prices for the other major destinations experienced more modest paces of growth.

outbreak,Financial literacy in Malaysia: challenges and opportunities,1.73789E+12,The Borneo Post,https://www.theborneopost.com/2025/01/26/financial-literacy-in-malaysia-challenges-and-opportunities/,https://news.google.com/read/CBMiowFBVV95cUxPcUdBSGRFVmc5V0l2SWJ1dWpJaUJQSU8xbTFpUThNbFNWZVE5Z0Z5djNtMVFXWEkxcDMtNzJNSnQtdzg1WTVBM1JVcUhYaWFQbFFhMTd3YmpWUlVlUFV3RVhGck1uSmFZa0dvcnRIMC1vMEVKVTlxZ0o3MnFkall4MVltUmY5QkplN19lU2pSakVuV3oxQW9oSjBLb21lSmh6WWV3?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://www.theborneopost.com/2025/01/26/financial-literacy-in-malaysia-challenges-and-opportunities/,"Financial literacy in Malaysia presents a mixed picture. A 2023 survey found that only 36% of Malaysians understood basic financial concepts such as interest rates, inflation and risk diversification, placing the country below the global average of 42%. However, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) Deputy Governor Adnan Zaylani noted in late 2024 that financial literacy has significantly improved since 2016, now exceeding the global average and approaching levels seen in developed nations.

Despite this progress, many Malaysians still struggle financially. A 2024 report showed that 61% could not produce RM1,000 in an emergency, and one in four felt burdened by debt. Additionally, nearly 70% of Malaysians reported needing financial literacy support: 21% lacked basic personal finance knowledge, and 48% were only beginning to grasp essential concepts. These statistics underscore the need for ongoing education to help Malaysians make informed decisions, manage debt effectively, and build financial resilience.

Many Malaysians remain unaware of how to invest effectively to build wealth. Most rely on savings accounts and the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), which provide limited returns. While options like forex, stocks, cryptocurrencies, and property investments exist, even simpler, safer investments like unit trusts are underutilised owing to a lack of awareness.

This lack of financial literacy was evident during the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite strong stock market performance and unit trust returns of 50% to 70% during the pandemic, a popular investment scheme in the country offered a modest return of just over 4%, citing pandemic challenges. Many of the investors accepted these returns without question, highlighting their limited financial awareness.

Investing, including in unit trusts, is a critical step toward wealth creation, financial security, and achieving long-term financial goals. With inflation at 2.8% in 2024, the value of money erodes over time, making investments that yield returns above inflation essential for preserving purchasing power. Unit trusts, managed by professional fund managers, offer individuals the opportunity to grow wealth through diversified portfolios comprising equities, bonds, and other assets. They simplify the investment process, making them ideal for beginners and those with limited time or expertise. With relatively low capital requirements, they are accessible to a wide range of investors.

One of the key benefits of unit trusts is diversification. By spreading investments across various sectors, asset classes, and geographic regions, they reduce the impact of losses from any single investment, making them a safer option for steady wealth accumulation. Unit trusts also help individuals achieve specific financial goals, such as retirement savings, education funding, or wealth building, through a structured and disciplined approach to financial planning. By investing in unit trusts, people can take control of their financial future, grow their wealth, and work toward financial independence with confidence.

Currently, Malaysia hosts 38 locally incorporated unit trust management companies, collectively managing 757 unit trust funds. These companies are all regulated by the Securities Commission Malaysia, the government agency responsible for overseeing and ensuring the integrity of the country’s capital market. Malaysia’s unit trust industry boasts several high-performing funds. Among them, the KAF Core Income Fund stands out with a five-year return of 209.19%, focusing on stable, income-generating assets and offering steady growth with reduced risk. The Kenanga Growth Fund Series 2 delivered a 77.41% return since its 2018 inception, consistently outperforming its benchmark. Meanwhile, international funds like the Manulife Investment U.S. Equity Fund and the Manulife India Equity Fund achieved impressive 10-year returns of 272.98% and 253.50%, respectively. Other strong performers include the AmChina A-Shares – MYR and the Franklin U.S. Opportunities Fund, with 10-year returns of 209.36% and 199.52%, respectively. For those seeking Islamic options, Dana Makmur Pheim was recognised with the 2024 Best of the Best Country (Malaysia) Award for its excellence in balanced fund management.

Comparing unit trusts to other familiar investment options such as fixed deposits (FDs), the EPF, and Amanah Saham Bumiputera (ASB) highlights their relative benefits. Unit trusts offer the highest potential returns, with top-performing funds exceeding 200% over 10 years and annualised returns ranging from 6% to 12%. However, they carry moderate to high risk, as returns depend on market performance, and their liquidity is moderate, with redemption taking a few days. In contrast, FDs guarantee returns of 2% to 4% annually, are low-risk, and ideal for capital preservation, though they impose penalties for early withdrawals, limiting liquidity. EPF provides consistent annual dividends averaging 5% to 6%, making it a safe and reliable option for long-term savings, but with limited liquidity as withdrawals are restricted to retirement or specific purposes. ASB offers stable dividends of 5% to 6%, backed by government guarantees, and is highly liquid, allowing withdrawals anytime.

In summary, unit trusts are suitable for investors seeking higher returns and willing to accept some risk, while FDs, EPF, and ASB cater to conservative investors prioritising stability and consistent earnings, with ASB offering the best liquidity. As a unit trust consultant, I am required by the authorities to include a disclaimer stating that past performance is not indicative of future results and that future outcomes may vary depending on economic conditions, market performance, and other influencing factors. Nonetheless, investing in unit trusts remains a powerful tool for Malaysians to secure their financial future, build wealth, and achieve long-term goals.

It was reported that existing landfills are operating beyond their capacities and might not be able to cope with the increasing waste volume in the long term.

However, the proposed incineration WTE development project in Rawang has attracted nearby residents’ objections which has caught the public’s attention. The protests were mainly due to residents’ concerns on environmental, safety and health issues that may arise from the operations of incineration WTE plants. Several NGOs have also raised their concerns regarding whether the incineration WTE plants are able to treat our commingled solid wastes with high moisture contents, and its impact towards the recycling and recovery initiatives from the communities and industries.

BTEP Bukit Tagar Sanitary Landfill Operating (right) and Closed (left) Phases

Economists have also indicated that high capital investments are required to develop and operate the incineration WTE plants, which might increase the financial burdens to the Government.

In fact, in Selangor State, there is an award-winning operating sanitary landfill equipped with a 12MW WTE plant utilizing Landfill Gas-to-Energy technology, which can cater for solid waste in the Northern Region of Selangor in the next 30 – 40 years. Bukit Tagar Enviro Park (BTEP), Hulu Selangor is developed and being operated by Berjaya Enviroparks Sdn Bhd, since 2011, under the supervision of Ministry of Housing and Local Government (KPKT) and Kuala Lumpur’s City Council (DBKL).

BTEP is receiving approximately 3,000 tons per day (tpd) from Kuala Lumpur, Selayang and Hulu Selangor, and it can cater for up to 6,000 tpd capacity of solid wastes from the Northern Region of Selangor State and private wastes from surrounding industrial areas in Selangor and also Genting Highlands, Pahang. BTEP is recycling biodegradable organic wastes which is 35% of the commingled solid waste into renewable energy.

An Overview of the Award-Winning Sanitary Landfill in Bukit Tagar Enviro Park (BTEP)

BTEP is a sustainable waste management facility sitting on 659 acres sized land. It is surrounded by a 1,000 acres of permanent buffer zone, which effectively ensures that any residential and commercial premises are 500m radius away from the site boundary in order to comply with the requirements imposed by Department of Environment (DOE) of Malaysia.

BTEP’s sanitary landfill has received numerous awards, both locally and abroad, for its pioneering efforts. Amongst the notable awards are:

• Waste Management Association of Malaysia (WMAM)’s Exceptional Facility Management Award Large Enterprise 2023

• The Institution of Engineers Malaysia, recognized BTEP’s invaluable contribution to the engineering industry in 2008 and 2021

• In 2019, BTEP earned the Merit Award in National Grid Renewable Energy at the National Energy Awards presented by The Ministry of Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change (MESTECC)

• BTEP also received global recognition in 2013, when it was honored with the Outstanding Singapore Environmental Achievement Award by the Singapore Environment Council.

BTEP’s sanitary landfill is designed and constructed as a fully engineered Level IV landfill based on the guidelines of Ministry of Housing and Local Government (KPKT), with a complete composite bottom liner system, leachate and landfill gas collection equipped with treatment systems to ensure full environmental protection from groundwater, surface water and air pollution.

Furthermore, BTEP’s sanitary landfill has been practicing daily HDPE cover liner instead of typical soil cover for daily waste tipping operations in order to effectively minimize odor and rainwater percolation into the landfilled wastes which reduces leachate (waste water) generation.

It has a State-of-the-Art Leachate Treatment Plant (LTP) with daily capacity of 2,200 cubic meter per day, which operates 24/7 to ensure that leachate is continually treated and monitored via advanced Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system to allow immediate response on leachate treatment and quality.

BTEP’s sanitary landfill operations has been complying to the operating standards and environmental compliance requirements imposed by the Local Authorities including KPKT, DBKL, Selangor State Government and DOE.

BTEP Renewable Energy Center and De-Carbonisation Initiatives

BTEP’s Renewable Energy Center has exported more than 400 million kWh of green electricity into the grid and has been recognised as the largest Waste-to-Energy (WTE) producer in Malaysia under the solid waste category. In addition, the Renewable Energy Center has recorded the highest Certified Emission Reduction (carbon credits) issued for a landfill project in South East Asia under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) scheme with a total of 2.7 million tonnes CO2 equivalent verified based on United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 2020 records.

Gas Engines in the Renewable Energy Plant

BTEP’s contribution to DBKL and other surrounding Local Authorities are:

Competitive and affordable tipping fee rates for solid waste treatment & disposal;

Support DBKL and Local Authorities’ aspirations in their efforts towards de-carbonisation to become carbon neutral cities by 2050;

Rapid response to Local Authorities’ requests in managing any emergencies e.g. flood incidents causing a sudden increase of solid wastes tonnages;

Participations in solid waste recycling & sustainability efforts and campaigns.

The Government via KPKT has launched a Circular Economy Blueprint for Solid Waste in Malaysia to promote solid waste recycling and recovery. BTEP’s initiatives are duly aligned with the Blueprint and is developing several programs to increase the recycling rate of solid waste and enhance sustainability, which includes:

Research on the production of animal feed or extraction of chitosan via Black Soldier Fly technology on Food Waste;

Production of Alternative Fuel from dried and combustible solid waste;

Installation of solar renewable energy system;

Rainwater harvesting and treatment of the surface water for on-site consumption.

“We provide quality service with full compliances to the Local Authorities’ requirements for our customers from DBKL, Majlis Perbandaran Selayang, Majlis Perbandaran Hulu Selangor and the Private Sectors (Industrial, Commercial & Institutional waste). We can increase our operating capacity fairly quickly to assist Local Authorities in Selangor State for the treatment and disposal of their solid wastes. Our facilities in BTEP will be able to treat and recycle bottom & fly ashes generated from the upcoming solid waste incineration WTE plants in the near future. We are fully committed to do our part in supporting the Government’s aspirations towards the direction of waste recycling in ensuring sustainability and wellbeing of the public, environment and future generations.” said Koh Chee Yong, the Managing Director of Berjaya Enviroparks Sdn Bhd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Naza Enviro Holdings Sdn Bhd.

outbreak,Public Caning in Terengganu: Full Implementation of Sharia Law in Malaysia?,1.73769E+12,fulcrum.sg,https://fulcrum.sg/public-caning-in-terengganu-full-implementation-of-shariah-law-in-malaysia/,https://news.google.com/read/CBMimgFBVV95cUxPLVlGdlFhLTN0aEtGUFZhTEQ2WUdEVWZhX0lIQWlOVExKRVNRdnU3SU8wVXM2emdYWld6VE9Xd0ZfVFV5OG9NcHpidzhjMlY4QV96Z3FSTTlJR0lLV0M4Qm1PYkFOay1WWWU2TmZ2Y0F4SUdHdlhsY0N5dTh0YVhPQjNTQkw2R1lfT2ZyV0NVMlR5ZXVGbVdZZU5n?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://fulcrum.sg/public-caning-in-terengganu-full-implementation-of-shariah-law-in-malaysia/,"An unprecedented public caning in Terengganu could pave the way for similar punishments in other states. This could lead to the full implementation of Syariah law.

On 20 November 2024, Senior Judge of the Terengganu Sharia High Court Kamalruazmi Ismail sentenced Mohd Affendi Awang to six lashes of the cane. The accused had pleaded guilty to the offence of committing khalwat (close proximity) for the third time. If this is not addressed by progressive elements, it could lead to similar punishments effected in other states.

The Terengganu court ordered the sentence to be carried out publicly at the Al-Muktafi Billah Shah Mosque in Kuala Terengganu on 6 December 2024 after Friday prayers, following the expiration of the appeal period. The accused was charged under Section 31(a) of the Sharia Criminal Offenses (Takzir) Enactment (Terengganu) Amendment 2022. In addition to the caning, the accused was fined RM4,000 (or a six-month jail term if the fine was not paid).

The caning is unprecedented. Terengganu and Sabah have carried out canings previously, but within court or prison compounds, and the punishment was only witnessed by family members of the convicted person. In this case, the accused was caned in a mosque, where it could be witnessed by members of the public. If left unchecked, this approach may become commonplace and widely accepted, potentially paving the way for the implementation of hudud laws (Sharia penal code). It should be stated that the caning according to takzir differs from caning under civil law; among other things, the type of cane and the method of caning are different.

This decision sparked criticism from progressive Islamic groups such as the Islamic Renaissance Front and Sisters in Islam. Most of their objections were directed towards Terengganu’s Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS) government. They centered on the normalisation of violence and questioned whether the punishment should be applied to instances of khalwat. Political analysts like Awang Azman Pawi and Hisomuddin Bakar also condemned the Terengganu government, arguing that the public caning was an attempt to deflect attention from the state’s administrative shortcomings, particularly in economic management.

Furthermore, influential figures such as the former Chief Commissioner of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission, Latheefa Koya, and the Mufti of Perlis Mohd Asri Zainul Abidin, have questioned the approach of administering public canings. Additionally, the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia has criticised public caning as a violation of human rights as it undermines the dignity of the offender and conflicts with international covenants.

It should be noted that the judgement has no direct connection to the PAS government, despite the party’s efforts to claim credit for it.

The passing of the sentence by a public servant in the Terengganu Sharia High Court implies that similar decisions could be made even if the Terengganu government were to be led by a different party. In other words, conservative ideologies are not PAS’ sole preserve; they have permeated into other political parties as well. This has also affected civil servants. Kamalruazmi Ismail has been a practitioner of Sharia law in Terengganu since 2006. He was appointed by the Sultan of Terengganu through the Government Gazette in November 2013 during Barisan Nasional’s administration, with the gazette being signed by the then Menteri Besar of the United Malays National Organisation, Ahmad bin Said.

This is not the first time Kamalruazmi has passed a public caning sentence. In 2018, he ordered the public caning of a lesbian couple. In both cases, he emphasised that the punishment served as a form of deterrence and would not harm the offenders.

In other words, conservative ideologies are not PAS’ sole preserve; they have permeated into other political parties as well. This has also affected civil servants.

It is worth noting that Kamalruazmi is not the only public servant inclined towards this approach. Others, such as Senior Judge Rosdi Harun of the Terengganu Sharia High Court, have meted out similar punishments.

The Minister of Religious Affairs in the Unity Government, Mohd Na’im Mokhtar, has been cautious in addressing this issue, stating that it falls within the jurisdiction of the state government.

The public caning ruling in Terengganu has the potential to pave the way for similar punishments in other states. Sharia court officials in other states may now freely refer to and propose such punishments. This is particularly evident given that authorities in several states have expressed support for this approach. For example, in 2018, following the caning of a lesbian offender, the Mufti of the Federal Territories, Zulkifli Al-Bakri, responded positively to the punishment.

The current Mufti of the Federal Territories, Luqman Abdullah, has also expressed support for the recent caning. He has called on all parties to respect Terengganu’s authority to implement its own legal approach. Simultaneously, Asmadi Mohamed Naim, the Mufti of Pahang, has endorsed public caning, arguing that it generates a sense of fear and deterrence. The Mufti of Sabah, Bungsu @ Aziz Jaafar, acknowledged that Sabah had previously carried out caning in a limited public setting in Tawau, Sabah, in 2017.

Other PAS-controlled states such as Kelantan and Perlis have indicated their intention to follow Terengganu’s lead in implementing public caning. Even Mohd Khairuddin Aman Razali, the Deputy Chair of UMNO’s Ulama wing and former PAS leader, has reacted positively.

PAS, which governs Terengganu, has openly stated that the caning marks the beginning of efforts to fully implement Sharia law. If this trend continues and is widely adopted by religious authorities, it may pave the way for the normalisation of public caning, which could eventually facilitate the implementation of hudud punishments, a goal pursued by conservative Islamic groups in Malaysia. It is worth noting that, as early as 2012, 62 per cent of Malaysian Muslims support the implementation of hudud. This would be of concern to those who support the Constitution and civil laws.

Progressive Islamic groups — especially those who claim to uphold the Constitution — oppose the new development. They should express their concerns comprehensively. It is insufficient to criticise or denounce PAS; they must seek ways to engage with religious authorities about the implications of such developments. Furthermore, they must acknowledge that the problem also lies with the growing conservatism among public servants.

IDE Research Centre executive director, Amidi Abdul Manan said Anwar’s long-standing efforts were emphasised by Bangladesh’s Chief Advisor, Prof Muhammad Yunus, during his participation as a panellist at the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2025 in Davos, Switzerland, which was also attended by the Prime Minister recently.

“Prof Muhammad Yunus’s statement at the World Economic Forum regarding Amanah Ikhtiar Malaysia (AIM) demonstrates PM Anwar’s commitment to uplifting vulnerable communities in Malaysia,” he said in a statement today.

Muhammad, a 2006 Nobel Peace Laureate, was recognised for introducing microcredit loans to empower underprivileged groups to start long-term businesses during Bangladesh’s famine crisis in 1974.

As a panellist during the WEF session titled “ASEAN, Even Stronger Together,” Muhammad, who is also the founder of Grameen Bank, said that Malaysia was the first country to adopt his microcredit idea through the establishment of AIM, initiated by Anwar, who was then the Education Minister.

Elaborating further, Amidi said that in 1987, Anwar instructed Universiti Sains Malaysia, which was under his ministry at the time, to conduct a study on the feasibility of the Grameen Bank concept.

“This study, led by Prof Dr Shukor Kassim and Prof Dr David Gibbon, ultimately led to the establishment of AIM,” he said.

Amidi said the Prime Minister’s efforts to assist the poor date back to 1974 when he was a student leader advocating for rubber smallholders in Baling who were suffering from the fall in rubber prices at the time.

“We also saw Anwar’s fight for the poor during his tenure as Agriculture Minister. He launched the Pasar Tani initiative in 1985 to combat exploitation by middlemen against poor rural farmers.

“That’s why in 2022, in his book Membangun Negara MADANI, he defined Ihsan (compassion) as:

‘…the feeling of ihsan is about empathising with the suffering and hardship of others and striving to find solutions to alleviate it…’

“The MADANI framework is the culmination of his four decades of experience in public service, coupled with over a decade of contemplating the country’s future. MADANI is not a mere slogan but a manifestation of loyalty and love from a leader towards his nation,” he said. — BERNAMA",1.73798E+12,en,0.08479552,2025-01-26 10:51:41,"['four', 'minister', 'time', 'asean', 'uplifting', 'middleman', 'anwars', 'negara', 'bangladesh', 'ibrahim', 'became', 'empathising', 'bank', 'mere', 'founder', 'shukor', 'vulnerable', 'rubber', 'feeling', 'decade', 'seri', 'famine', 'exploitation', 'compassion', 'instructed', 'agriculture', 'coupled', 'start', 'fight', 'nobel', 'pasar', 'muhammad', 'amanah', 'lumpur', 'ikhtiar', 'director', 'feasibility', 'stronger', 'world', 'others', 'leader', 'introducing', 'peace', 'smallholder', 'madani', 'idea', 'session', 'together', 'panellist', 'participation', 'prof', 'striving', 'evident', 'economic', 'tani', 'crisis', 'also', 'forum', 'recently', 'emphasised', 'regarding', 'student', 'longstanding', 'experience', 'loyalty', 'business', 'loan', 'manan', 'group', 'today', 'launched', 'ministry', 'saw', 'long', 'commitment', 'datuk', 'fall', 'amidi', 'framework', 'abdul', 'improving', 'led', 'farmer', 'initiated', 'slogan', 'centre', 'davos', 'yunuss', 'date', 'life', 'future', 'hardship', 'ultimately', 'alleviate', 'statement', 'elaborating', 'grameen', 'nation', 'effort', 'education', 'manifestation', 'suffering', 'baling', 'advisor', 'yunus', 'service', 'bernama', 'first', 'price', 'universiti', 'membangun', 'defined', 'country', 'ide', 'recognised', 'wef', 'poor', 'attended', 'research', 'david', 'people', 'love', 'underprivileged', 'executive', 'longterm', 'community', 'gibbon', 'solution', 'study', 'sains', 'culmination', 'contemplating', 'laureate', 'ihsan', 'advocating', 'aim', 'tenure', 'kuala', 'public', 'book', 'towards', 'empower', 'thats', 'anwar', 'microcredit', 'kassim', 'find', 'assist', 'switzerland', 'initiative', 'chief', 'establishment', 'conduct', 'rural', 'back', 'malaysia', 'adopt', 'said', 'concept', 'titled', 'prime', 'even', 'demonstrates', 'combat']",Neutral

KEY TAKEAWAYS What will Honda be launching in 2025? The confirmed Honda e:N1 EV and unconfirmed HR-V Facelift will probably join the already launched Honda Civic Facelift. Honda will only launch 1 EV in Malaysia? Well, they remained tight-lipped, but their plan is to introduce 3 in the next 3 years.

Honda Malaysia Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer Mr. Hironobu Yoshimura unveiled that Honda Malaysia will be launching three new vehicles this year to help boost their chances of achieving their sales target.

We’ve already seen the first one—the facelifted Honda Civic, which debuted in January. The second will be Honda’s first fully electric vehicle in Malaysia, the e:N1. But what about the third?

Honda Malaysia hasn’t officially named it yet, but if we had to take an educated guess, it’s most likely going to be the HR-V facelift. Surprised? It might feel like the HR-V just hit the market, but in reality, it was launched back in 2022. Time really does fly!

Honda unveiled the 2025 HR-V facelift in Thailand last November 2024, featuring subtle styling updates, enhanced technology, and a refined hybrid-only lineup.

Photo from Honda Malaysia

The exterior gets a redesigned front bumper, sleeker taillights, and new two-tone alloy wheels, while the flagship RS variant boasts matrix projector LED headlights with active cornering and a sportier look.

Inside, the HR-V now offers a more symmetrical center console with added storage, an 8-inch touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, rear air vents, illuminated vanity mirrors, and USB-C ports on higher variants. The EL and RS trims also gain an 8-way power-adjustable driver’s seat and wireless charging.

Honda Sensing remains standard, providing advanced driver-assistance features, while the hybrid powertrain continues unchanged, delivering 131 PS, 253 Nm, and an impressive 25.6 km/l fuel efficiency.

With Honda continuing to push both internal combustion and hybrid (e:HEV) technology alongside its new electrification strategy, the HR-V facelift could bring key updates to keep it fresh in a competitive segment.

Photo from Adam Aubrey

If this speculation turns out to be true, expect a slightly tweaked design, more tech, and potentially even powertrain improvements.

It seems like the HR-V lineup will be expansive this coming year because although the e:N1 is not officially named as a HR-V, there’s no doubt it is one.

Honda produces the fully electric e:N1 SUV, at its Rojana Industrial Park facility in Thailand, making it the first Japanese brand to locally assemble electric passenger cars in the country.

When asked whether the e:N1 will be locally assembled in Malaysia like most of their vehicles, they remained tight lipped and said more information will come in due course.

Anyway, assembled in Malaysia or Thailand, they will be launching it here. The e:N1 is essentially the electric version of the HR-V, known as the e:Ny1 in Europe.

It is built on the e:N Architecture F platform, featuring a high-rigidity body structure, improved aerodynamics, and a low center of gravity for enhanced driving dynamics.

Powering the e:N1 is a front-mounted electric motor delivering 204 hp and 310 Nm of torque, paired with a 68.8 kWh battery. It offers a WLTP-rated range of up to 412 km per charge, with DC fast charging enabling a 10-80% top-up in 45 minutes.

On the inside, the biggest differences between it and its ICE cousins is a large infotainment screen which boosts its digital appeal, probably to showcase some electrification information clearly.

Honda Malaysia’s big plans for 2025 include not just new models but also a stronger focus on after-sales services and digitalization.

Photo from Honda Malaysia

With 104 dealerships nationwide and over 430,000 HondaTouch platform users, the brand is ensuring customers have seamless access to services.

Will the HR-V facelift complete the trio of 2025 launches? We’ll just have to wait and see. Stay tuned!

The transfer, through Malaysia Petroleum Management, took effect on Tuesday, Jan 21, making ConocoPhillips Sabah Gas the sole operator of the oil and gas field cluster.

Previously, the KBBC PSC was operated by Kebabangan Petroleum Operating Company Sdn Bhd, a joint operating company comprising Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd, Shell Energy Asia Ltd, and ConocoPhillips Sabah Gas Ltd.

“With an export capacity of up to 750 million standard cubic feet of gas per day, the continuation of the KBBC PSC until the end of 2050 and other commercial agreements have been structured to ensure future gas field developments remain economically attractive in supporting Sabah's energy security requirements,” Petronas said in a statement.

Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor said the state is rapidly emerging as a preferred destination for oil and gas investments, thanks to the strategic developments and partnerships that Petronas and its industry collaborators championed.

State tourism and creative economy committee chairman Wong Hon Wai said PIA recorded 64,507 aircraft movements in 2024, narrowly surpassing Kota Kinabalu International Airport’s 63,822 movements.

“This also exceeded Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport in Subang, which logged 59,929 movements, and Kuching International Airport, with 54,969 movements,” Wong said in a statement today.

KLIA retained its top spot with 366,895 movements, underscoring its dominance in Malaysia’s aviation network.

“These figures highlight Penang’s critical role in the national aviation network and its rapid growth as an international hub for tourism and business,” Wong added.

PIA also handled a total passenger volume of 7,473,462 in 2024, marking a 7.07 per cent increase from 6,979,748 passengers in 2023.

Wong attributed the growth to Penang’s popularity among domestic and international travellers, supported by an increase in flight frequencies to the state.

“In 2024, the airport recorded 565 weekly flights, up 8.03 per cent from 523 in 2023,” he said.

International flight frequencies rose from 259 weekly flights in 2023 to 304 in 2024, with 12 new direct international routes to 10 cities launched since August last year.

Penang now boasts direct connections to 20 cities, including Shanghai, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Hong Kong, Dubai, Singapore, Bangkok, Phuket, Jakarta, Taipei, Doha, Chennai, and Chongqing.

Wong said Penang’s extensive international flight network would be a cornerstone for the state’s growing tourism industry in the years ahead.",1.73775E+12,en,0.539848089,2025-01-24 07:16:22,"['per', 'direct', 'supported', 'underscoring', 'penangs', 'critical', 'rapid', 'including', 'logged', 'aviation', 'civil', 'wong', 'chongqing', 'cent', 'george', 'surpassing', 'town', 'lumpur', 'taipei', 'domestic', 'narrowly', 'last', 'retained', 'airport', 'shenzhen', 'year', 'network', 'added', 'dominance', 'international', 'committee', 'kota', 'increase', 'boast', 'popularity', 'also', 'weekly', 'since', 'passenger', 'kong', 'become', 'kinabalu', 'creative', 'business', 'launched', 'today', 'phuket', 'klia', 'state', 'extensive', 'cornerstone', 'jan', 'aziz', 'chairman', 'abdul', 'xiamen', 'sultan', 'highlight', 'caam', 'volume', 'attributed', 'role', 'hub', 'august', 'doha', 'hon', 'kuching', 'penang', 'statement', 'among', 'city', 'shanghai', 'flight', 'figure', 'chennai', 'subang', 'authority', 'bangkok', 'guangzhou', 'exceeded', 'jakarta', 'route', 'rose', 'tourism', 'movement', 'national', 'ahead', 'growth', 'handled', 'would', 'total', 'hong', 'according', 'connection', 'second', 'busiest', 'kuala', 'recorded', 'economy', 'shah', 'traveller', 'growing', 'singapore', 'pia', 'top', 'marking', 'aircraft', 'data', 'industry', 'malaysia', 'frequency', 'said', 'spot', 'new', 'wai', 'dubai']",Positive

Deputy Prime Minister who is also Rural and Regional Development Minister, Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi at the opening ceremony of the 2025 RISDA Field Officers Convention, here, today.

BANGI, Jan 23 (Bernama) -- Malaysia is targeting to reclaim its position as the world’s leading rubber producer within the next decade, said Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi. He said that the goal is achievable, provided that replanting efforts and innovation within the rubber industry are carried out comprehensively and systematically. “I have discussed this with the director and chairman of the Rubber Industry Smallholders Development Authority (RISDA), and I believe we can achieve this within 10 years. Malaysia has 800,000 hectares of rubber plantations, with 400,000 hectares in need of replanting,” said Ahmad Zahid, who is also the Minister of Rural and Regional Development.

“The replanting process must utilise high-quality saplings and automated methods for tapping and collection,” he said to the media, after attending the opening ceremony of the 2025 RISDA Field Officers Convention, here, today. Ahmad Zahid also highlighted that this initiative includes promoting the use of rubber wood in the furniture industry, not as raw material, but as treated rubber wood, thus increasing its market value. “This means that the proceeds from rubber wood will become significantly more valuable. We anticipate that this will provide a sufficient resource for RISDA to operate independently, without relying on the government budget. This is our commitment, insya-Allah,” he said.

He also reflected on Malaysia’s former position as the global leader in the rubber industry, noting that the country is now ranked 10th. ""Malaysia was once the world's number one rubber producer, contributing 50 per cent. Today, we have fallen far behind, with neighbouring country now producing one-third of the global rubber output. “However, I am confident that, with the enthusiasm, dedication, and commitment of everyone involved, we will not only overcome the challenges ahead, but also elevate this industry to greater heights.

In this Holy Year, the faithful are encouraged to become pilgrims of hope by embracing the ‘See, Judge, Act’ method, a core approach of the Young Christian Workers (YCW) movement.

KUALA LUMPUR: In this Holy Year, the faithful are encouraged to become pilgrims of hope by embracing the ‘See, Judge, Act’ method, a core approach of the Young Christian Workers (YCW) movement.



This call was made by Fr Fabian Dicom during a thanksgiving Mass held on January 11 at the Church of Our Lady of Fatima, honouring the departed leaders of YCW Malaysia. Msgr Daniel Lim, former national chaplain of YCW, concelebrated the Mass, which also saw the presence of Gabrielite Brother Francis Xavier Gasper from Montfort Boys’ Town, Shah Alam.

The YCW movement, founded in 1925 by Cardinal Joseph Cardijn, was built around the methodology of ‘See, Judge, Act,’ which encourages ordinary workers to reflect on their lived realities through the lens of the Gospel and take actionable steps to improve their circumstances.



Fr Fabian highlighted the relevance of this approach in the context of the Holy Year, calling on the faithful to become “pilgrims of hope.” “The YCW legacy invites us to apply this powerful methodology to bring about social change, grounded in the teachings of the Gospel,” he said.



Fr Fabian, who is also the director of Caritas Malaysia, reflected on the importance of the 'See' phase, which involves discernment, listening, and learning. He observed that in Malaysia, the marginalised are disproportionately affected by social issues such as corruption, political self-interest, economic inequality, and racial discrimination. “These challenges create a climate of mistrust, division, and systemic injustice,” he said, noting that even within the Church, there is often a tendency to focus on rituals rather than addressing pressing social issues.



The Caritas director acknowledged the decline of movements like the YCW but emphasised that the need for action in the face of social injustice is still urgent. He noted that there were signs of hope, with individuals and groups inspired by YCW continuing to champion the dignity of workers and promote justice, as well as Church-based initiatives addressing poverty, climate change, and migration.



Fr Fabian then turned to the second part of the YCW methodology: ‘Judge.’ Reflecting on the baptism of Jesus, he quoted Luke 3:21-22, where God affirms Jesus as His beloved Son, a declaration extended to all baptised Christians. “Through baptism, we are entrusted with the mission of living out this identity.” He further quoted Luke 4:18, in which Jesus proclaims His mission to bring good news to the poor and set the oppressed free, stressing that as baptised Christians, we are called to live out that same mission.



“The Gospel compels us to see the inherent dignity of every person,” he declared, adding that for the poor and marginalised in Malaysia, this means advocating for justice and equality. He urged the congregation to reflect on how they could contribute to the transformation of society, calling for genuine interfaith and interracial harmony and addressing the root causes of suffering.



The final step in the methodology is ‘Act.’ Fr Fabian encouraged the congregation to respond with courage and compassion. He posed two critical questions: “How do we bring the Gospel to life?” and “How do we live the dignity of our baptism?”



As a response, he called on the faithful to become “pilgrims of hope” not only in personal devotion but also in social transformation. He suggested that this could involve collaborating with other faith communities to oppose corruption, advocating for fair wages for migrant workers, supporting local educational initiatives for underprivileged children, and voicing concerns for marginalised groups.",1.73798E+12,en,0.296860546,2025-01-26 12:48:05,"['supporting', 'turned', 'collaborating', 'invite', 'critical', 'quoted', 'pressing', 'embracing', 'injustice', 'thanksgiving', 'caritas', 'lived', 'systemic', 'selfinterest', 'ritual', 'devotion', 'champion', 'judge', 'concelebrated', 'extended', 'around', 'context', 'reality', 'grounded', 'step', 'methodology', 'xavier', 'social', 'compassion', 'identity', 'acknowledged', 'respond', 'act', 'face', 'congregation', 'inspires', 'town', 'worker', 'actionable', 'educational', 'lumpur', 'tendency', 'director', 'january', 'mission', 'political', 'dicom', 'year', 'bring', 'change', 'faithful', 'within', 'teaching', 'often', 'harmony', 'transformation', 'suggested', 'leader', 'live', 'urgent', 'church', 'hope', 'powerful', 'held', 'question', 'lady', 'declaration', 'circumstance', 'could', 'presence', 'son', 'toh', 'living', 'cardinal', 'economic', 'learning', 'individual', 'also', 'discrimination', 'good', 'improve', 'become', 'listening', 'contribute', 'call', 'emphasised', 'jesus', 'posed', 'final', 'gospel', 'involves', 'mean', 'genuine', 'patricia', 'highlighted', 'voicing', 'racial', 'group', 'response', 'saw', 'honouring', 'baptism', 'mass', 'jan', 'cardijn', 'discernment', 'set', 'courage', 'called', 'beloved', 'root', 'encouraged', 'wage', 'affirms', 'issue', 'migration', 'free', 'two', 'challenge', 'person', 'well', 'jubilee', 'society', 'anthony', 'baptised', 'fair', 'see', 'news', 'addressing', 'rather', 'life', 'legacy', 'lim', 'god', 'core', 'sign', 'proclaims', 'inspired', 'ordinary', 'observed', 'decline', 'noted', 'apply', 'entrusted', 'inherent', 'suffering', 'daniel', 'continuing', 'poverty', 'interracial', 'oppressed', 'boy', 'adding', 'need', 'declared', 'fabian', 'joseph', 'relevance', 'action', 'corruption', 'create', 'equality', 'francis', 'encourages', 'poor', 'stressing', 'compels', 'promote', 'method', 'young', 'focus', 'every', 'gabrielite', 'alam', 'founded', 'lens', 'movement', 'interfaith', 'justice', 'underprivileged', 'brother', 'phase', 'climate', 'national', 'approach', 'made', 'personal', 'montfort', 'former', 'community', 'built', 'faith', 'migrant', 'noting', 'concern', 'oppose', 'second', 'advocating', 'kuala', 'reflect', 'part', 'cause', 'shah', 'mistrust', 'holy', 'take', 'inequality', 'churchbased', 'child', 'disproportionately', 'calling', 'importance', 'msgr', 'local', 'initiative', 'affected', 'fatima', 'reflected', 'still', 'ycw', 'pilgrim', 'marginalised', 'malaysia', 'division', 'president', 'departed', 'said', 'chaplain', 'dignity', 'involve', 'even', 'christian', 'luke', 'urged', 'left', 'gasper', 'reflecting', 'like']",Neutral

The benchmark palm oil contract FCPO1! for May delivery on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange lost 67 ringgit, or 1.47%, to 4,487 ringgit ($1,005.60) per metric ton by the midday break.

""The futures are mirroring sell-off in Chicago's soyoil futures and in South American markets on Friday night and weakness in Dalian's palm olein and soyoil futures in Asian hours,"" said Anilkumar Bagani, head of research at Mumbai-based vegetable oil broker Sunvin Group.

""The market has also followed the weaker Malaysian palm oil export performance in February.""

Dalian's most-active soyoil contract (DBYcv1) was up slightly at 0.03%, while its palm oil contract CPO1! lost 0.4%. Soyoil prices on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) ZL1! fell 0.14% earlier in the session from Friday's closing level but reversed course to trade up 0.32%.

Palm oil is affected by the price movements in related oils as it competes for a share of the global vegetable oils market.

Malaysian palm oil products exports in February are estimated to fall 8.5%-11%, according to independent inspection company AmSpec Agri Malaysia and cargo surveyor Intertek Testing Services.

Meanwhile, Indonesia has lowered its crude palm oil reference price to $954.50 per ton in March, a trade ministry official said on Friday, but export tax will remain at $124 a ton.

Oil rose on Monday as upbeat manufacturing data from China, the world's biggest crude importer, led to renewed optimism for fuel demand, although uncertainty about a Ukraine peace deal and global economic growth from potential U.S. tariffs loomed.

Stronger crude oil futures make palm a more attractive option for biodiesel feedstock.

Palm oil FCPO1! may retest support at 4,473 ringgit per metric ton, as a wave c from 4,624 ringgit looks incomplete, Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao said.

The operation followed a tip-off indicating that two vehicles were involved in smuggling migrants from Chana to Thepa district, according to Police Colonel Chanokruadee Pongsiri, superintendent of Highway Police Division 7. The Thai drivers were identified as 44 year old Donjaras Marnbao and 30 year old Nurhasan Dee-mae.

Donjaras was driving the Honda sedan, which acted as a lookout vehicle, while Nurhasan was in the Pajero, transporting seven men and three women from Myanmar. Both drivers and all the Myanmar nationals have been taken into police custody for further legal proceedings.

The drivers admitted to being paid 2,000 baht (US$60) each for picking up the migrants from the roadside in Songkhla’s Rattapoom district and transporting them to Mueang district of Pattani province, where another vehicle was scheduled to collect them. They disclosed that a Pattani resident, known to them only as Bae-Ning, had hired them and that they had undertaken similar trips previously, reported Bangkok Post.

Pol. Col. Chanokruadee noted that most of the Myanmar nationals, mainly from Yangon, had been travelling for five days before their arrest. They were expected to pay approximately 120,000 baht (US$3,570) each to a Myanmar broker in Malaysia upon reaching their destination.

ZANZIBAR CITY, Tanzania, March 3, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — The Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association (WIOMSA), in collaboration with The Pew Charitable Trusts and the University of Southampton, has announced the launch of the Large-Scale Seagrass Mapping and Management Initiative (LaSMMI). This ambitious research endeavor will develop the first field-verified seagrass map across Kenya, Tanzania (including Zanzibar), Mozambique, and Madagascar.

Seagrass meadows are critical coastal habitats that support biodiversity, and play a significant role in carbon sequestration. Despite their importance, seagrasses remain among the least studied and most threatened marine ecosystems. The LaSMMI project will leverage satellite imagery analysis and field verification techniques to produce highly accurate maps of these vital habitats. Seagrass will be mapped in shallow water environments found along a combined coastline of more than 9,500 km (6000 mi), and spread across more than 2 million sq km (800,000 sq miles) of sea area.

“Seagrasses are the unsung heroes of our oceans—vital for marine life, coastal communities, and the fight against climate change”, said Dr. Arthur Tuda, Executive Director of WIOMSA. “Yet, they remain among the least understood and least protected ecosystems. Through the LaSMMI project, we are unlocking the power of science and collaboration to bring seagrasses into the spotlight, ensuring they are mapped, valued, and safeguarded. By bridging global data with local action, we are shaping a future where seagrasses are not just seen, but actively protected as a cornerstone of ocean health and resilience.”

LaSMMI delivers more than just mapping —it is a comprehensive effort to enhance seagrass research and policy integration, with multiple key objectives:

Creating a standardized, field-verified seagrass map by the end of 2026.

Assessing carbon stock values across the region to support climate strategies.

Strengthening local research capacity through training and workshops on data collection, analysis, and field verification.

Raising national and regional awareness about seagrass conservation and its role in climate mitigation.

Strengthening policy linkages by incorporating seagrass data into Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement, marine spatial planning, and management and sustainability frameworks.

“LaSMMI represents a crucial step toward ensuring the Western Indian Ocean’s coastal ecosystems are recognized, protected, and integrated into global climate strategies,” said project lead Dr. Gwilym Rowlands, Associate Professor for marine conservation and management at the University of Southampton. “By bridging the gap between science and policy, this initiative will drive meaningful conservation actions that benefit both marine biodiversity and coastal communities.”

LaSMMI is built on a strong foundation of partnerships, bringing together top-tier research institutions in the region, including the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute, the University of Dar es Salaam and the State University of Zanzibar (Tanzania), Eduardo Mondlane University (Mozambique), and the University of Toliara – Institute of Fisheries and Marine Sciences (Madagascar).

“Seagrass meadows, often overlooked and underprotected, are vital to our planet,” said Dr. Stacy Baez, a senior officer with Pew’s advancing coastal wetlands conservation campaign. “LaSMMI is on a mission to map these underwater ecosystems in the Western Indian Ocean and estimate the carbon they store, fueling seagrass conservation efforts for the benefit of nature, people, and climate.”

LaSMMI follows on the success of the Seychelles Seagrass Mapping and Carbon Assessment project that developed the first field verified seagrass map and carbon stock assessment for the country. This highly collaborative project helped to inform Seychelles’ commitment to protect all seagrass meadows in their 2021 NDC. LaSMMI will employ the same scientific methods, including the use of available satellite data combined with on-the-ground information to create seagrass maps. These maps will provide essential data for governments, conservationists, and marine spatial planners to better protect and manage seagrass meadows across the Western Indian Ocean.

Country leads quotes:

Dr. Jacqueline Uku, Principal Research Scientist at the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI)

“I started out my career in the late 1990’s as a seagrass scientist with the big vision of putting little known seagrasses on the Kenyan map. The LaSMMI project is a long-awaited initiative for us in Kenya and it will fulfil my vision for this critical ecosystem. I am awed by all the opportunities that this project presents in raising the next generation of seagrass scientists.”

Dr. Blandina Lugendo, Marine Scientist and Dean of the School of Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Technology at the University of Dar es Salaam,Tanzania

“Seagrass meadows are among the most valuable shallow coastal ecosystems, nonetheless, they are not well understood, and hence not fully appreciated or effectively conserved. The LaSMMI Project presents an opportunity to map seagrasses in the Western Indian Ocean region in order to better understand them and enhance their conservation, since it is difficult to protect what we don’t know.”

Dr. Ali Ussi, Senior Lecturer at the Department of Natural Sciences, State University of Zanzibar

“The LaSMMI project exemplifies the State University of Zanzibar’s unwavering commitment to sustainable marine resource management, highlighting our dedication to seagrass conservation through strategic international collaborations and informed local expertise. This initiative is fundamental in enhancing biodiversity and serves as a critical component in the climate change mitigation strategy for the Western Indian Ocean region.”

Prof. Salomão Bandeira (PhD), Associate Professor at Eduardo Mondlane University in Mozambique

LaSMMI highlights seagrass as a carbon superpower, enabling climate adaptation, coastal protection, and supporting fisheries, all through collaborative efforts that empower community resilience in the Western Indian Ocean region.”

Dr. Nirinarisoa Lantoasinoro Ranivoarivelo, senior lecturer at the Institute of Fisheries and Marines Sciences at the University of Toliara, Madagascar.

“The LaSMMI project underscores the importance of seagrass conservation, highlighting their role in supporting marine life, storing carbon, and protecting coastlines. This global initiative demonstrates a collective effort to preserve biodiversity and promote sustainable ocean stewardship.”

Photo Credit: Adobe Stock/??????? ????

The weather can be hard to predict at the best of times, but it’s something event organisers are having to be increasingly mindful of. In 2024 alone, the Asia-Pacific region experienced devastating floods, cold snaps and strong typhoons. How are these extreme weather episodes affecting event destination and venue choices and to what extent does this weigh upon the destination decision-making process?

Hadrian Tsang, senior business development manager at CWT Meetings & Events, says planners are increasingly factoring in the risk of extreme and unpredictable weather events when selecting destinations for their events. This shift is not only about ensuring the safety and well-being of attendees, but also about minimising potential financial losses and logistical challenges.

“There is a growing preference for destinations that are perceived to be less vulnerable to climate-related disruptions, and clients are prioritising venues that have robust infrastructure and contingency plans in place to handle such incidents,” he says. “Destinations and venues that demonstrate resilience and sustainability, such as having flood management systems or energy-efficient operations, are becoming more attractive.”

“There is a growing preference for destinations that are perceived to be less vulnerable to climate-related disruptions, and clients are prioritising venues that have robust infrastructure and contingency plans in place to handle such incidents.” Hadrian Tsang, senior business development manager, CWT Meetings & Events

Tsang adds that planners are also incorporating risk assessments for natural disasters into their decision-making processes, ensuring the safety and accessibility of the event. CWT Meetings & Events works with partners such as International SOS to provide its clients with access to a comprehensive suite of risk management, safety and security solutions for their events.

As well as considering climate risks, Tsang says that clients are also factoring in the environmental impact of their events, opting for destinations with sustainable tourism practices and lower carbon footprints. The reputational risk associated with hosting events in environmentally-sensitive areas has also become a consideration.

For Atika Rosli, chief and founder at Beyond Events Asia, the impact of climate change has made destination and venue selection more complex.

“We’ve seen clients reconsider hosting outdoor events in regions like Bangkok or Ho Chi Minh City during the monsoon season due to the risk of flooding,” she says. “Similarly, typhoon seasons in the Philippines and coastal parts of Vietnam are prompting planners to either avoid these destinations during peak periods or ensure venues have strong contingency measures in place. On the other hand, destinations like Singapore, with its well-managed urban infrastructure and indoor venue options, have become increasingly appealing.”

“[The unpredictability of weather] has pushed us to integrate hybrid formats or indoor options more frequently into event designs,” Atika Rosli, chief and founder, Beyond Events Asia

Rosli has noted a shift toward cooler or climate-controlled destinations. For example, cities like Tokyo and Kyoto in spring or autumn have become increasingly popular for their pleasant weather, making outdoor activities and cultural experiences more enjoyable. At the same time, regions in southeast Asia with access to cooler highlands, such as Chiang Mai in Thailand or Cameron Highlands in Malaysia, are being looked on favourably because of their more temperate climates.

The unpredictability of weather remains a concern, even in traditionally stable seasons. “This has pushed us to integrate hybrid formats or indoor options more frequently into event designs,” adds Rosli.

Lorela Chia, founding president of the Malaysia Association of Sustainable Supply Chain & Innovation (MASSCI), says it isn’t about cutting corners; it's about realising that some destinations, no matter how beautiful or popular, simply aren’t equipped to handle the changing climate. And the risks, both in terms of safety and business continuity, are no longer worth the gamble.

""Cooler destinations are now the new trend. As temperatures climb, the demand for temperate climates is growing.” Lorela Chia, founding president, Malaysia Association of Sustainable Supply Chain & Innovation

“Cooler destinations are now the new trend. As temperatures climb, the demand for temperate climates is growing,” she says. “Countries like Denmark, the Czech Republic, and parts of Ireland are experiencing a surge in tourism, thanks in part to their more moderate weather and commitment to sustainability. These destinations not only offer relief from the heat but also align perfectly with the growing demand for eco-friendly venues.”

Venues in these cooler climates also tend to have a smaller carbon footprint, use renewable energy, and promote greener practices – factors that are playing a significant role in the decision-making process. The message, says Chia, is clear: sustainability, both in terms of the environment and the long-term viability of the destination, matters.

“The impact of climate change on event planning is not just a passing concern – it’s reshaping the industry,” adds Chia. “It’s crucial for both clients and organisers to recognise the role they play in creating resilient, sustainable events. From selecting climate-conscious destinations to implementing green practices, we have the opportunity to lead by example.”",1.73798E+12,en,0.021543145,2025-01-26 09:59:28,"['beyond', 'robust', 'reshaping', 'time', 'lead', 'flood', '????', 'meeting', 'logistical', 'philippine', 'enjoyable', 'atika', 'moderate', 'stock?????', 'weigh', 'supply', 'carbon', 'work', 'attendee', 'sustainability', 'perfectly', 'flooding', 'period', 'choice', 'reputational', 'disaster', 'comprehensive', 'southeast', 'say', 'hard', 'founder', 'either', 'adobe', 'demonstrate', 'prioritising', 'ensuring', 'vulnerable', 'urban', 'frequently', 'typhoon', 'organiser', 'episode', 'security', 'season', 'coastal', 'unpredictable', 'indoor', 'crucial', 'predict', 'strong', 'minh', 'credit', 'energyefficient', 'format', 'popular', 'use', 'chain', 'matter', 'energy', 'planner', 'plan', 'considering', 'complex', 'pushed', 'greener', 'hybrid', 'offer', 'consideration', 'avoid', 'option', 'climatecontrolled', 'attractive', 'message', 'infrastructure', 'rosli', 'change', 'chia', 'worth', 'term', 'contingency', 'chiang', 'massci', 'upon', 'longer', 'integrate', 'thanks', 'asia', 'perceived', 'pleasant', 'weather', 'lorela', 'event', 'wellmanaged', 'senior', 'international', 'cameron', 'autumn', 'opportunity', 'unpredictability', 'thailand', 'opting', 'cultural', 'also', 'accessibility', 'increasing', 'venue', 'area', 'spring', 'republic', 'become', 'equipped', 'management', 'changing', 'climateconscious', 'surge', 'remains', 'hand', 'trend', 'stable', 'experiencing', 'experience', 'extent', 'business', 'appealing', 'alone', 'potential', 'founding', 'renewable', 'incident', 'association', 'factor', 'similarly', 'place', 'asiapacific', 'loss', 'commitment', 'significant', 'impact', 'viability', 'selection', 'clear', 'less', 'gamble', 'temperature', 'design', 'challenge', 'well', 'safety', 'footprint', 'highland', 'mai', 'role', 'green', 'ireland', 'natural', 'provide', 'lower', 'continuity', 'climb', 'factoring', 'something', 'play', 'city', 'resilient', 'incorporating', 'snap', 'financial', 'development', 'noted', 'disruption', 'traditionally', 'region', 'arent', 'planning', 'cooler', 'demand', 'simply', 'resilience', 'environmental', 'manager', 'measure', 'affecting', 'implementing', 'bangkok', 'tend', 'decisionmaking', 'country', 'becoming', 'assessment', 'handle', 'peak', 'favourably', 'access', 'prompting', 'example', 'passing', 'creating', 'align', 'promote', 'ensure', 'playing', 'innovation', 'cold', 'toward', 'hosting', 'activity', 'corner', 'best', 'minimising', 'tourism', 'vietnam', 'climate', 'made', 'longterm', 'smaller', 'add', 'climaterelated', 'solution', 'looked', 'denmark', 'partner', 'tokyo', 'concern', 'system', 'experienced', 'part', 'kyoto', 'cutting', 'associated', 'temperate', 'selecting', 'growing', 'practice', 'mindful', 'operation', 'cwt', 'singapore', 'beautiful', 'czech', 'environment', 'realising', 'monsoon', 'weve', 'chief', 'due', 'isnt', 'reconsider', 'heat', 'industry', 'malaysia', 'relief', 'president', 'photo', 'increasingly', 'client', 'chi', 'extreme', 'hadrian', 'even', 'risk', 'environmentallysensitive', 'devastating', 'suite', 'shift', 'sustainable', 'process', 'seen', 'making', 'new', 'ecofriendly', 'recognise', 'destination', 'preference', 'outdoor', 'wellbeing', 'like', 'tsang']",Neutral

By Vijian Paramasivam PHNOM PENH, Jan 26 (Bernama) -- A big concern lurking in the background of ASEAN’s economic prosperity, besides climate change, is declining birth and fertility rates that could disturb its growth prospects. As fewer babies are being born in Southeast Asia due to changing lifestyles and urbanisation, it could be a real crunch on economic productivity.

While it is a populous region with about 670 million people, Southeast Asian governments need to address the demographic shift to an ageing population and declining birth rates, say experts. According to the “ASEAN Key Figures 2023” report, ASEAN is the third-most populous region in the world, following India and China. ASEAN Briefing’s Deputy Editor, Ayman Falak Medina, says climate change and declining birth rates are concerns for the region’s growth prospect.

“Although climate change will pose a challenge for ASEAN, I believe a bigger challenge will be tackling the declining birth and fertility rates, as this will impact overall productivity and thus the ability of each country to fight climate change. “Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia are all experiencing demographic shifts due to ageing populations,” he told Bernama in an email interview. (ASEAN Briefing is a publication by international corporate services firm Dezan Shira and Associates.) Population decline can impact economic growth and social development, labour scarcity and shrinking youth population, say experts, while others argue that slowing population growth has its positives.",1.73798E+12,en,-0.326212466,2025-01-26 11:06:47,"['deputy', 'following', 'asean', 'email', 'birth', 'china', 'background', 'bigger', 'southeast', 'say', 'medina', 'ageing', 'india', 'real', 'prosperity', 'fewer', 'social', 'pose', 'fight', 'firm', 'besides', 'thirdmost', 'associate', 'urbanisation', 'dezan', 'world', 'others', 'change', 'prospect', 'populous', 'penh', 'scarcity', 'asia', 'could', 'publication', 'lurking', 'international', 'baby', 'thailand', 'economic', 'shrinking', 'argue', 'key', 'changing', 'address', 'tackling', 'experiencing', 'born', 'although', 'corporate', 'labour', 'jan', 'impact', 'positive', 'believe', 'productivity', 'challenge', 'lifestyle', 'crunch', 'youth', 'decline', 'interview', 'big', 'development', 'region', 'falak', 'figure', 'briefing', 'fertility', 'million', 'disturb', 'service', 'bernama', 'overall', 'need', 'country', 'demographic', 'ability', 'people', 'vietnam', 'phnom', 'climate', 'report', 'growth', 'thus', 'expert', 'paramasivam', 'according', 'population', 'concern', 'asian', 'government', 'vijian', 'ayman', 'rate', 'editor', 'singapore', 'shira', 'due', 'declining', 'malaysia', 'slowing', 'shift', 'told']",Neutral

This year marks the 33rd anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between our countries. Over this period, Uzbek-Malaysian relations have been developing consistently and fruitfully, based on the principles of friendship, equality, mutual support, respect and consideration of each other's interests.

The traditional close ties of friendship between the Uzbek and Malaysian peoples are based on common religion, similarity of customs and cultural values.

The main goals and objectives of the strategic development and modernization programs «Uzbekistan-2030» and «Malaysia MADANI» implemented by our countries also demonstrate similarity and are aimed at ensuring sustainable economic growth and improving the quality of life and well-being of the population.

High-level visits and established mechanisms of interstate dialog have played an important role in promoting and deepening bilateral interaction.

To date, six high-level visits have been conducted. In 2020, «friendship groups» were established between the parliaments of the two countries, which significantly intensified inter-parliamentary dialogue. Consequently, in April 2023, Johari bin Abdul, Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Malaysian Parliament, visited Uzbekistan. In June 2024, Nur Jazlan Mohamed, the Deputy President of the Senate of the Parliament of Malaysia visited our country. In return, a parliamentary delegation led by Speaker of the Legislative Chamber of Oliy Majlis Nuriddin Ismoilov paid a visit to Malaysia in July 2024.

Political consultations between the foreign ministries of the two countries are held regularly, where the sides discuss current issues on the bilateral agenda. Six rounds of political consultations have taken place thus far. Notably, delegations led by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Uzbekistan visited Malaysia in February and July of 2024.

A solid legal framework has been established between the two countries, consisting of 25 intergovernmental and other documents.

Furthermore, Tashkent and Kuala Lumpur closely coordinate within the framework of regional and international organizations such as the UN, CICA, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and the Non-Aligned Movement, mutually supporting each other's initiatives and demonstrating a convergence of positions on the most pressing global and regional issues.

It is important to note that a more active dynamic in Uzbek-Malaysian relations has been observed in recent years. Thanks to the active and trusting political dialogue between the leaders of the two countries - President of the Republic of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev and Prime Minister of Malaysia Anwar Ibrahim, Uzbek-Malaysian cooperation is now filled with new content and reaching a higher level.

Undoubtedly, Anwar Ibrahim's visit to Uzbekistan in May 2024 gave a significant impetus to bilateral interaction. As a result of this visit, important agreements were reached and new directions were outlined for further expanding cooperation between the countries.

In particular, a Joint Statement on Deepening Multifaceted Cooperation was signed, which reaffirmed the commitment to further strengthening of political dialog, inter-parliamentary ties, trade and investment, cultural and humanitarian interaction. The leaders emphasized the need to elevate bilateral relations to the level of a comprehensive partnership in the near future.

Following the Uzbek-Malaysian Business Forum held in Samarkand as part of the visit, a solid package of 19 investment agreements worth over $3 billion was signed.

In this context, it is important to emphasize that in recent years there has been a steady growth in bilateral trade turnover between the countries, which has increased 2.5 times since 2020. The number of joint ventures with Malaysian capital in Uzbekistan has reached 37.

During the visit, in order to further intensify trade and economic cooperation, it was decided to transform the existing bilateral Trade Committee into an Intergovernmental Commission. Its first meeting was successfully held in Kuala Lumpur in May 2024.

In addition, the parties agreed to create a special Uzbek-Malaysian industrial zone to promote high-tech projects. Undoubtedly, its creation will significantly deepen industrial cooperation between the countries and lay the foundation for the formation of joint productions with high added value.

In this context, an important direction of industrial cooperation could be the production of microelectronics and semiconductors. As it is known, Malaysia has achieved high results in the development of the semiconductor industry, which accounts for 25% of the country's GDP. It ranks 6th in the world in semiconductor exports and accounts for 13% of the global market for testing and assembling microchips.

In the near future, Malaysia has set a goal of becoming a leading «chip design powerhouse» and increasing its share of the global semiconductor trade from the current 7% to 14% by 2029. To achieve this goal, a National Semiconductor Development Strategy was adopted in 2024, with plans to invest about $107 billion in its implementation.

Uzbekistan, which has a significant resource potential of rare earth metals, also aims to actively develop the production of semiconductors and microelectronic products, which are becoming increasingly in demand on the global market. In this regard, our country is interested in establishing cooperation with Malaysia to develop the semiconductor industry and launch joint startup projects in this area.

Another significant direction of industrial cooperation could be pharmaceuticals. Malaysia is one of the leaders in the production of pharmaceutical products. In 2024, the profit of its pharmaceutical industry amounted to more than $1.7 billion.

Uzbekistan also actively supports the development of the pharmaceutical industry and has abundant natural resources that can be used for the production of medicines. In this regard, there is a great potential for creating joint ventures for the production of pharmaceuticals, as well as conducting joint scientific research in the field of pharmacology.

An important area of Uzbek-Malaysian cooperation is also the «halal» industry. This sphere is of particular interest to Uzbekistan taking into account the current trends of its growth on a global scale. In recent years, the global «halal» market has been growing rapidly and is now valued at $2.6 trillion. According to forecasts, by 2030 it will reach $5 trillion.

In turn, Malaysia is among the largest exporters of «halal» products and is recognized as a world leader in «halal» certification, including food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. Today, exports of these products in Malaysia account for 17.3% of the country's total exports.

The «halal» industry is regulated by the Department of Islamic Development of Malaysia, known as JAKIM, which serves as the competent authority being responsible for halal certification in Malaysia. Its certificate is recognized in 49 countries around the world, which indicates a high level of confidence in this certificate and its international recognition.

It should be noted that since 2018, the Department of Islamic Development of Malaysia and the Agency “Uzstandart” started cooperation on the introduction of «halal» certification system in Uzbekistan. Further intensification of cooperation in this direction will significantly increase the competitiveness of Uzbek goods in the markets of Muslim countries and will play an important role on the way of Uzbekistan's integration into the global supply chains of «halal» products.

Islamic banking may become another key area of bilateral cooperation. Today, the Islamic banking system is increasingly becoming an important part of the global financial sector. According to the Islamic Corporation for the Development of the Private Sector, total Islamic banking and financial assets worldwide exceed $4.5 trillion. According to forecasts by the international market research company «Mordor Intelligence», the compound annual growth rate in the Islamic finance market will be more than 10% in 2024-2029.

To date, Malaysia is recognized as an international center of Islamic finance. It was one of the first to introduce laws on Islamic banking and Islamic insurance. The size of the Islamic interbank money market is about one-third of the total market, and Shariah-compliant securities account for 81% of listed stocks. In addition, Malaysia has a well-developed training system in the field of Islamic finance. The International Center for Education in Islamic Finance (INCEIF) is the leading institution in this direction. In this regard, Uzbekistan is interested in intensifying cooperation with the Malaysian side on the development of Islamic banking in our country, as well as in training specialists in this sphere.

Uzbekistan and Malaysia attach particular importance to the expansion of cultural and humanitarian ties, which contribute to deepening mutual understanding and enrichment of the cultures of the two peoples.

Every year, cooperation in tourism, health care and sports is expanding, educational and academic exchanges are being strengthening. This facilitated by regular joint conferences, symposia, exhibitions, tourism fairs, culture and cinema days, concerts and festivals.

The achieved level of bilateral cooperation in the sphere of education and personnel training deserves special attention. For example, within the framework of the Malaysian Government's Technical Cooperation Program, more than 850 specialists from Uzbek ministries and agencies have upgraded their qualifications at various short-term courses and seminars in Malaysia. Today, about 500 Uzbek students are studying at prestigious Malaysian universities.

In 2021, a branch of Malaysia's «Binary» International University was opened in Urgench, which trains specialists in management, information technology and entrepreneurship. At the same time, our country is interested in further expansion of cooperation with leading universities in Malaysia in such areas as green energy, artificial intelligence, creative economy, Islamic banking, «halal» industry and others.

There is huge potential for cooperation in the tourism sector. Both citizens of Malaysia and Uzbekistan have a 30-day visa-free regime. Thanks to this, in recent years there has been a steady growth in the number of Malaysian tourists visiting Uzbekistan. If in 2023 their number was 4396 people, then by the end of 2024 their number reached 8854 people.

On the territory of our republic there is a large number of unique architectural monuments, ancient mosques and madrassas, tombs and burial places of great Islamic theologians, scientists such as Imam al-Bukhari, Imam at-Termezi, Imam Moturidi, Bahauddin Naqshbandi and others, which arouse great interest among Muslims from all over the world.

It must be acknowledged that thanks to the measures taken to develop ziyorat tourism in our republic, today Uzbekistan is becoming one of the largest centers of pilgrimage in the Islamic world. This evidenced by the growth of our country's position in various global ratings. Thus, in the Global Muslim Travel Index (GMTI-2023), Uzbekistan took 13th place among 140 countries in the direction of international pilgrimage tourism. At the Halal in Travel Awards 2023, Khiva was awarded as «Islamic Destination of the Year».

It is noteworthy that in 2024 Uzbekistan was honored with a prestigious award by Malaysia. Our country was recognized in the nomination «Best Asian Travel Destination with Rich Architectural Heritage». In this regard, it is important for the countries to expand cooperation on the creation of joint tours with a focus on the development of ziyorat tourism in the cities of Bukhara, Samarkand, Tashkent, Khiva, where historical Islamic monuments are concentrated.

In general, it can be stated with confidence that Uzbekistan and Malaysia are long-term partners whose interests coincide in most areas of interaction. A solid foundation has been laid in our relations for the further development of bilateral cooperation for the benefit of the peoples of the two states.",1.73798E+12,en,0.410068303,2025-01-26

Celebrating the International Day of Clean Energy, this year's event coincided with the 16th anniversary of the foundation of IRENA and reiterated the global commitment to providing universal clean energy access and meeting the climate goals pledged during the UAE Consensus at the culmination of COP28.

Hosted at the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) Sustainability and Innovation Centre, the initiatives focus on driving gender equity in diplomacy and energy leadership while fostering innovative and inclusive dialogue to address the global energy transition.

In a bid to strengthen its impact, this event welcomed Permanent Representatives to IRENA, diplomats, and energy leaders to reflect on the progress of these programmes, share best practices, and refine their roadmap for the future.

Participants also contributed to identifying key themes and structures for future sessions and discussed ways to increase momentum for the gender equity and energy transition dialogues ahead of COP30 in Belem, Brazil.

In her opening remarks, Dr. Amna bint Abdulla Al Dahak, UAE Minister of Climate Change and Environment, stated, ""On International Day of Clean Energy, and as we mark IRENA's 16th anniversary, the UAE reaffirms its commitment to a just and inclusive clean energy transition. This collaborative session on the subject of Women in Diplomacy and Renewables underscores the importance of gender equity and inclusion in driving sustainable development. By empowering women and ensuring their participation, we unlock the full potential of the global energy sector. We are proud to host this important dialogue and to work alongside IRENA and other nations to accelerate the global shift towards clean energy.""

IRENA Director-General Francesco La Camera said, ""I thank the United Arab Emirates for their steadfast partnership in accelerating the global energy transition as we celebrate this year's International Day of Clean Energy. This day not only marks the anniversary of IRENA's founding on 26 January 2009, but it also serves as a clear reminder of the potential of renewables to address climate change, foster sustainable development, reduce pollution, and shape a clean energy future for all. Despite record growth in renewables, the global distribution of renewable power remains alarmingly uneven, with the Global South increasingly being left behind.

By championing gender equity and energy leadership, we're not just expanding representation - we're unleashing diverse perspectives and innovative solutions to tackle our world's most existential climate and energy challenges.""

While stocks in some regions saw slight gains, others ended the day in the red, reflecting global market uncertainty.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 Takes a Dip

In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index (NKY:IND) fell 0.56% to 38,362, reaching its lowest point in over a month. The decline came as Wall Street indexes closed lower on Thursday, weighed down by earnings reports from major companies such as Morgan Stanley and UnitedHealth Group. The losses in Japan reflect investor caution following the mixed earnings results, along with global economic concerns.

Shanghai Composite Shows Modest Gains

The Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP) bucked the trend, edging up 0.40% to 3,249. While mainland stocks faced challenges in finding a clear direction, the positive movement was partly driven by the latest economic data out of China. The country’s economy grew by 1.6% in Q4, surpassing the 1.3% growth seen in Q3. This marked the strongest quarterly growth since Q1 2023, offering a glimmer of hope amid ongoing market volatility.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index Advances

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index (HSI) gained 0.17%, rising to 19,556. This was the fourth consecutive day of gains, with traders reacting to the fresh economic data from mainland China. The positive sentiment fueled by China’s economic growth gave the Hang Seng a modest boost, though global concerns over corporate earnings and inflation remained on investors’ minds.

Malaysia and Singapore Show Economic Growth

Malaysia reported a 4.8% year-on-year growth in Q4, a slight slowdown from the 5.3% expansion in the previous quarter. Despite the deceleration, Malaysia’s economic performance remained relatively solid.

Meanwhile, Singapore’s non-oil domestic exports surged by 9% year-on-year in December 2024, following a more modest 3.4% increase in November. This stronger-than-expected export performance helped support investor confidence in the region’s economic resilience.

India’s Sensex Falls

In India, the Sensex (SENSEX) fell by 0.45% to 76,693, reflecting investor concerns amid global economic uncertainties. The Indian market mirrored the global trend, as mixed earnings from U.S. companies and inflation concerns weighed on sentiment.

Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Edges Lower

Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 (AS51) dipped by 0.17% to 8,312, surrendering some of the previous session’s gains. However, the index remained on track to post a modest weekly gain, bolstered by the surprise slowdown in U.S. core inflation. The Australian market’s resilience reflected investor optimism about potential easing inflationary pressures in the U.S.

U.S. Futures Move Higher

As Asian markets closed, U.S. futures moved higher, with the Dow up by 0.14%, the S&P 500 increasing by 0.19%, and the Nasdaq rising by 0.23%. This uplift in futures suggests some optimism heading into Friday’s trading session, despite the mixed earnings reports from major U.S. companies.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a cornerstone of technological progress, promising breakthroughs across industries from healthcare to finance and reshaping global economies.

“The development and deployment of AI must be guided by responsible governance. This lays the groundwork for innovation while safeguarding citizens and societal values,” said Adrian Marcellus, Chief Executive Officer of MyDIGITAL Corporation.

“By addressing ethical concerns, developing regulatory frameworks and fostering international collaboration, Malaysia can set a precedent for inclusive and equitable AI governance in Southeast Asia,” he added.

As Malaysia progresses toward becoming a regional leader in AI, the government has started its journey with the launch of the National AI Roadmap 2021-2025, the publication of the National Guidelines on AI Governance and Ethics, and the establishment of the National AI Office.

While advancements in AI adoption in diverse fields highlight Malaysia’s potential as a hub for AI, they also underscore the critical need for robust governance to mitigate risks such as algorithmic bias and data misuse. A well-structured governance framework will enable Malaysia to maximize AI’s economic potential, projected to contribute RM115 billion to the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030, according to a study by AT Kearney, while minimizing societal harm.

Three Key Pillars in AI Governance

The Future of AI Governance in Malaysia whitepaper, developed collaboratively by ISIS Malaysia, Malaysia Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (MYCentre4IR) and Microsoft, emphasizes that governance mechanisms must address AI’s socio-technical nature.

To ensure robust AI governance, Malaysia’s strategy must rest on three key pillars: ethical principles, regulatory mechanisms, and capacity building.

1. Ethical Principles. Malaysia’s National AI Roadmap 2021-2025 outlines seven guiding principles, including fairness, transparency, and accountability. These principles are critical for fostering trust among stakeholders — from citizens to private sector entities. They also serve as the foundation for sector-specific guidelines, ensuring tailored approaches to AI deployment in areas such as healthcare, education and cybersecurity. More importantly, these principles must be operationalised with clear mechanisms to translate ideals into action.

Global practices, such as the EU’s AI Act and the OECD’s AI Principles, can serve as references. However, Malaysia’s approach should take into account inclusivity and cultural relevance, addressing the unique challenges faced by the country’s diverse multicultural population.

2. Regulatory Mechanisms. Rather than rushing to implement hard regulations, Malaysia is wisely adopting a risk-based and phased approach. This strategy allows for accelerated adoption where there are low-risk situations, enables iterative learning and avoids stifling innovation. Instead of creating new policies or regulations, extant policies and regulations can be strengthened to account for these emerging AI risks.

For instance, strengthening the Personal Data Protection Act to take into account developments in data practices due to the adoption of AI and driving discussions to determine policies for AI-enabled cybersecurity threats via the National Cyber Security Committee are critical steps.

This also extends to the idea of sectoral governance, enabling industry-specific nuances to be addressed effectively. For example, the use of AI in healthcare might need to pay closer attention to patient safety and data confidentiality, while the use of AI in communications may need to focus more on transparency.

In addition to AI principles and regulatory mechanisms, AI safety should also be on Malaysia’s radar. Operationalising AI safety involves a risk-based approach that may require embedding rigorous testing, validation, and monitoring processes throughout the lifecycle of AI systems when used for critical functions. By prioritizing AI safety, Malaysia can build public trust and create a foundation for sustainable AI adoption that aligns with societal values and expectations.

3. Capacity Building. Addressing talent gaps is another paramount focus for Malaysia’s AI ambitions. The AI Talent Roadmap 2024-2033 and the establishment of Malaysia’s first AI faculty at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia are promising steps for the country. These initiatives aim to produce skilled professionals capable of developing, auditing, and managing AI systems responsibly.

However, Malaysia must do more to address the brain drain of AI talent to higher-paying markets abroad. Incentives, such as grants, scholarships, and tax relief for AI professionals, could help retain and attract expertise.

Workshop on AI Governance in a Shifting Environment organised by Malaysia Centre4IR, ISIS Malaysia and Microsoft, held on 27 June 2024 in Putrajaya, Malaysia.

Building a Responsible AI Future

In 2025, Malaysia should leverage its ASEAN chairmanship year to highlight its domestic achievements and demonstrate its commitment and leadership for a responsible and sustainable AI future for the region.

By championing ethical AI practices, Malaysia can position itself as a global thought leader in this domain. Malaysia’s unique geopolitical position as a bridge between East and West, as well as an interlocutor of the Global North and South, offers a strategic advantage. This allows Malaysia to shape a balanced approach to AI governance that considers diverse perspectives. As AI continues to evolve, so too must the frameworks that govern it. Good governance and an enabling environment will help to foster high quality and impactful innovations.

InvestKL, the government agency entrusted to steer GKL’s rise as a top investment destination for leading global companies continues its mission under the visionary leadership of CEO Datuk Muhammad Azmi Zulkifli.

“Every investment we secure is a building block for a stronger Malaysia, adding new heights to global competitiveness. Over and above our accomplishments are the value add and immense spillover economic benefits these investments bring — shaping a modern Malaysia defined by innovation, resilience and shared prosperity,” Azmi says.

A decade of strategic impact

Starting with a blank canvas and joined by a pioneering team of talented professionals, InvestKL has achieved significant milestones since its inception in 2011. Under its stewardship, the agency has attracted over 140 multinational companies (MNCs) to GKL as at 3Q2024, generating 31,000 high-value jobs with an average salary of RM14,000 per month. These investments have brought RM33 billion in committed foreign direct investment (FDI), demonstrating Malaysia’s growing appeal to global companies, leveraging GKL as the gateway.

“InvestKL is about creating value beyond numbers,” Azmi emphasises. “These investments are about transforming lives, industries and the future of Malaysia.”

Driving growth through key sectors

Driven by its ambition to become Asean’s economic powerhouse, Malaysia is making steady progress towards achieving high-income nation status. This journey is supported by its robust infrastructure, vibrant ecosystem, dynamic talent pool and a conducive regulatory environment.

GKL’s vision as a hub for Global and Modern Services echoes Malaysia’s plans to transition from traditional manufacturing to an innovation-led, technology-driven economy and is further reinforced by Budget 2025, which introduces the New Investment Incentive Framework to attract high-impact investments.

Central to InvestKL’s success is its strategic focus on high-impact sectors that are reshaping the global economy. These include digital and advanced technology sectors, aligning with global shifts towards automation, cutting-edge technologies and artificial intelligence (AI).

Azmi notes that Modern Services, encompassing digitalisation, sustainability and knowledge-driven industries, represents the new frontier for economic growth.

InvestKL is responsible for bringing in high net-worth investments from companies such as McDermott, Cognizant, Air Liquide, AstraZeneca, MODEC and The Arnott's Group, to name a few. These global leaders are driving innovation, creating high-value jobs and integrating seamlessly with the local ecosystem.

""These contributions solidify Malaysia’s position as a regional leader in advanced industries,” Azmi explains.

Empowering talent and businesses

Malaysia’s diverse and talented workforce plays a pivotal role in supporting the ambitions of leading global companies considering GKL as a regional hub. As the nation advances towards becoming a knowledge-based economy, it has implemented forward-thinking initiatives to foster innovation, enhance business openness and drive greater competitiveness.

At the heart of InvestKL’s strategy is its commitment to empowering local talent exemplified by initiatives like Fit4Work, launched in 2020 to prepare Malaysians for high-demand sectors, while partnerships with MNCs and universities offer tailored upskilling opportunities.

Beyond job creation, local small and medium enterprises (SMEs) also benefit from partnership opportunities and growth advantages, gaining access to global supply chains and cutting-edge technologies. These collaborations foster co-innovation, enhancing the competitiveness of Malaysian businesses on a global scale.

“Over the years, the synergy between the expertise of MNCs and the opportunities within local SMEs in Malaysia have driven significant innovation and enhanced the capabilities of the business ecosystem,” Azmi explains.

“SMEs form a substantial and vital backbone of the nation’s economy. It’s not just about attracting big names,” he adds. “It’s about ensuring our local businesses grow alongside them, fostering partnerships that benefit everyone.”

As part of the Twelfth Malaysia Plan blueprint, the GKL Live Lab programme — now in its fifth year — is another impactful initiative by InvestKL that focuses on innovation-led investments. Fostering a powerful network among MNCs, start-ups, SMEs and universities, companies under the GKL Live Lab portfolio drive cutting-edge, technology-driven activities that accelerate digital transformation, enhance R&D capabilities and create opportunities for GKL's business ecosystem.

Global recognition and strategic goals

GKL has gained international acclaim, being recognised as among the Top 35 Cities Globally for Future Growth Potential (Global Cities of the Future Report 2021/22) and ranked as Southeast Asia’s Second Most Competitive City (Oxford Economics Global Cities Index). These accolades underscore InvestKL’s strategic role in advancing GKL’s business interests and strengthening its global competitiveness.

“Greater Kuala Lumpur is a city of possibilities,” says Azmi. ""GKL’s recognition as a business city on the global stage is a testament to the hard work, vision and determination of our ministries, partners and also the InvestKL team.""

The visionary leadership behind the change

Azmi’s tenure reflects a commitment to strategic foresight, sustainability and inclusive growth. Since joining InvestKL in 2012 and becoming CEO in 2019, he has redefined the agency’s approach to FDI, as part of the Madani economy vision, ensuring that every investment contributes to Malaysia’s long-term economic resilience with key investment considerations in economic complexity, high-value jobs, strong domestic linkages and environmental, social and governance (ESG).

According to reports in Straits Times, an anonymous tip-off about computer servers that might contain Nvidia chips being exported to Malaysia, and possibly to an unknown destination, sparked off the police investigation.

According to Reuters, three men, including a Chinese national, were charged with fraud last week in Singapore.

Investigations into the three men were carried out independently by Singapore after authorities received an anonymous tip-off and not requested by the US or any other country.

Domestic media linked the case to the transfer of Nvidia's AI chips from Singapore to Chinese artificial intelligence firm DeepSeek.

""We assessed that the servers may contain Nvidia chips,"" said Shanmugam.

He said the servers involved in the case were supplied by Dell Technologies and Super Micro Computer to Singapore-based companies before they were sent to Malaysia.

""Whether Malaysia was the final destination ... we do not know for certain at this point,"" he said, adding that the authorities were investigating the case independently.

Shanmugam said Singapore has asked Malaysian and US authorities to share relevant information to assist in investigations.

“If the servers did contain US export-controlled items, we have told the US that we would be happy to work with them and support any investigations in the US on that,” the minister said.

The United States is investigating if DeepSeek, the Chinese company whose AI model's performance rocked the tech world in January, has been using US chips that are not allowed to be shipped to China, Reuters reported earlier.

On January 20, he announced the creation of the External Revenue Service to collect tariffs from foreign countries and enrich US citizens.

Although he did not mention China in that respect, it remains the most obvious target of such tariffs. During the presidential campaign, Trump vowed to impose tariffs as high as 60 per cent on Chinese imports. These would likely be on specific goods, whereas most Chinese goods would be more likely to see tariffs of about 20 per cent . He has also threatened to impose an additional 10 per cent tariff on Chinese goods, portraying it as a penalty on China for enabling the flow of fentanyl, a drug responsible for thousands of deaths in the United States each year.

However, China had already started reorienting its supply chains and trade relations away from the United States when Trump first imposed tariffs on Chinese exports and banned Chinese telecommunication operators . In an attempt to address the effects of US tariffs, Beijing moved to strengthen its trade and investment relations with Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America through its Belt and Road Initiative and other efforts.

It is now expanding its presence and production plants in several countries across a variety of sectors, ranging from traditional industries such as oil , mining and transport to new pursuits including telecommunications, fintech and green energy . The reorientation of China’s supply chains has been to the benefit of a broad array of countries.

Investment, Trade and Industry Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz said industries across the region are redesigning supply chains with a focus on resilience, while policymakers are fostering collaboration to mitigate risks and seize new opportunities.

“Navigating US-China relations is going to be important for Malaysia and Asean because the supply chain is so critical to the region. Companies are engaging with us. They are redesigning it based on resilience, security, and commercial considerations.

“As policymakers, when we engage with our neighbours and partners, we must diversify and mitigate risks,” he shared in a brief posting on X following the recently concluded World Economic Forum 2025.

Tengku Zafrul said Malaysia’s National Energy Transition Roadmap aligns with regional efforts such as the Asean Power Grid to ensure accessibility to renewable energy.

He noted that advancements in artificial intelligence or AI and digital technologies also present growth opportunities, despite challenges such as chip export restrictions.

He highlighted Malaysia’s position as a small, open economy with a trade-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio of around 180%.

“For Malaysia, 80% of exports are in manufacturing, while only 20% are in agriculture.

“The manufacturing sector contributes a quarter, or 25%, of our GDP,” he said.

He also emphasised Asean’s collective strength as the fifth-largest economic bloc globally, with a GDP of US$3.8 trillion and a population of 680 million.

“With that trajectory, we should become the fourth-largest economic bloc,” he added. — Bernama",1.73798E+12,en,0.424886763,2025-01-27 00:14:20,"['minister', 'following', 'asean', 'neighbour', 'supply', 'sector', 'across', 'critical', 'grid', 'brief', 'export', 'present', 'around', 'trade', 'security', 'seri', 'collective', 'posting', 'diversify', 'fifthlargest', 'agriculture', 'going', 'chain', 'energy', 'collaboration', 'globally', 'lumpur', 'investment', 'domestic', 'consideration', 'shared', 'world', 'concluded', 'must', 'chip', 'added', 'trillion', 'mitigate', 'power', 'opportunity', 'aligns', 'economic', 'also', 'forum', 'transition', 'based', 'accessibility', 'restriction', 'become', 'recently', 'emphasised', 'regional', 'trajectory', 'policymakers', 'highlighted', 'renewable', 'engaging', 'seize', 'datuk', 'aziz', 'strength', 'important', 'technology', 'abdul', 'challenge', 'maintain', 'redesigning', 'open', 'position', 'role', 'tradetogross', 'green', 'ratio', 'zafrul', 'uschina', 'product', 'gdp', 'navigating', 'noted', 'effort', 'region', 'bolster', 'resilience', 'million', 'fourthlargest', 'global', 'fostering', 'manufacturing', 'bernama', 'amid', 'commercial', 'dynamic', 'ensure', 'focus', 'innovation', 'digital', 'despite', 'roadmap', 'company', 'national', 'growth', 'intelligence', 'population', 'partner', 'kuala', 'economy', 'relation', 'evolving', 'bloc', 'artificial', 'contributes', 'initiative', 'advancement', 'engage', 'industry', 'malaysia', 'said', 'intensifying', 'risk', 'new', 'quarter', 'small', 'tengku']",Neutral

PETALING JAYA – As the Chinese New Year draws near, city dwellers in Malaysia have their hearts set on reuniting with loved ones ahead of the festive celebrations.

Many were seen embarking on their cherished “balik kampung” (going back to home towns) journeys over the weekend.

A snapshot of this annual rush unfolded at Terminal Bersepadu Selatan in Bandar Tasik Selatan.

There were long queues of travellers – patience mixed with anticipation – at ticket counters, kiosks and departure halls.

Similarly, at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA), Malaysians of all backgrounds were spotted navigating the bustling terminals before the festivities, which also coincide with the school holidays.

To cater to the travel demands during the holidays, Malaysia Airlines introduced 102 additional red-eye flights, bringing the total number of weekly flights between Kuala Lumpur, Sabah and Sarawak to 219.

Malaysia Aviation Group managing director Izham Ismail said the additional capacity would help to increase convenience, and support the feeling of unity during the festive season.

“Chinese New Year is a time for togetherness. We are proud to support our customers with additional capacity and fixed fares to make their journeys more convenient and memorable.

“This is made possible through the government’s support in making air travel affordable for Malaysians and ensuring they can reunite with their loved ones with ease.

“We look forward to welcoming over 190,000 domestic passengers travelling on board Malaysia Airlines during this festive holiday period,” Datuk Izham said on Jan 26.

Earlier, Transport Minister Anthony Loke attended a ceremony to send off two red-eye flights at KLIA’s Terminal 1.

As part of the programme, Mr Loke distributed goodies at the boarding gate to departing passengers on flights MH7414 to Tawau and MH7436 to Sandakan to commemorate the occasion. THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK

LEGOLAND Malaysia is changing the game, setting new standards for inclusivity in theme parks across the region.

What Does the Certification Mean for Visitors?

To earn the Certified Autism Center™ designation, LEGOLAND Malaysia underwent extensive training and certification for all guest-facing staff, focusing on autism awareness, sensory-friendly practices, and effective communication. Additionally, an onsite audit ensured the park meets stringent accessibility standards.

Here’s what guests can now expect:

Staff trained in autism awareness to provide support and assistance.

LEGOLAND Malaysia is dedicated to ensuring every family can enjoy a fun, safe, and memorable experience. This is just the beginning of our journey to make the park even more accessible for all.”

A Pioneering Move for Malaysia’s Tourism Industry

LEGOLAND Malaysia’s achievement sets a groundbreaking precedent for accessibility in Malaysian tourism. The park’s efforts align with a broader global movement toward inclusive travel, where attractions, hotels, and destinations are making conscious efforts to accommodate neurodiverse travelers.

Myron Pincomb, CEO and Board Chairman of IBCCES, praised the initiative:

“We are thrilled to welcome LEGOLAND Malaysia as the first Certified Autism Center™ in Malaysia. This milestone demonstrates the park’s commitment to making tourism more accessible, ensuring all families—regardless of sensory sensitivities—can enjoy their visit with confidence.”

Why This Matters: The Future of Inclusive Tourism

The travel industry is evolving, with more destinations recognizing the importance of inclusivity and sensory-friendly environments. IBCCES, a global leader in cognitive disorder training and certification, has been working with theme parks, hotels, aquariums, and tourist attractions worldwide to improve accessibility standards.

PETALING JAYA: Acquisitions of Chinese companies intending to pull out or scale down operations in the country is one step that could be taken to minimise the possible economic fallout from US President Donald Trump’s tariffs, say experts.

Other measures include diversification of the supply chain while capitalising on Malaysia’s Asean chairmanship to promote the country as a gateway to tap the growing regional market, particularly for renewable energy and green technology.

Prof Dr Yeah Kim Leng, who is also part of the Finance Minister’s panel of special advisers, said both the private sector and government have a role to play to offset the impact of lower exports to the United States due to the tariffs.

“One way is seeing Malaysian-owned companies carrying out mergers or acquisitions (M&A) of foreign companies such as those from China which are affected by the tariffs.

“If there is a willing buyer and willing seller and the Malaysian company has the capacity to take over the other company, they can do so.

“But it is important to ensure that the acquisition will not be subjected to the tariffs,” he said.

Besides this drastic measure, Prof Yeah said local companies should also look at other markets for exports in anticipation that the US market would be shut off by the tariffs.

“The key here is for the companies to seek new and non-conventional markets such as from the Global South countries.

“From the government’s side, it should ink trade agreements to allow these companies to export their products to these countries to minimise the sharp decline in exports to the US if it happens,” he said.

Prof Yeah, a senior fellow and director of the Economic Studies Programme at the Jeffrey Cheah Institute on Southeast Asia at Sunway University, said the government could also look at providing indirect incentives aimed at diversifying the supply chain, particularly those involving locally owned small and medium enterprises.

“Perhaps, some form of indirect incentives can be given to support these companies for certain procurements.

“This is already happening as part of the push towards renewable energy such as solar power which Malaysia is pushing for,” he added.

As Asean Chair, Prof Yeah said Malaysia could attract investors for easier access to the regional markets by leveraging the Asean free trade agreements.

He said if the impact of the tariffs on local companies were severe, government intervention would be needed such as what was done during the Covid-19 pandemic.

“The government can look at providing support like how it was done during the pandemic.

“This could be financial aid such as a loan or through policies involving procurement,” he said.

Prof Yeah said such a move would help affected companies and also provide better job security.

Recently, it was reported that several Chinese-owned solar panel manufacturers are scaling back or halting operations due to a dip in profits following US tariffs last year with further tariffs expected.

In December last year, the Biden administration announced a 25 per cent rate hike in solar wafers and polysilicon and a 50 per cent increase in duties for tungsten products, which took effect on Jan 1 this year.

Last Thursday, Trump reiterated his recent threat of imposing tariffs on the European Union including a 10 per cent punitive duty on Chinese imports.

Malaysia is a major hub for solar panel manufacturing in the region with exports totalling about RM7.88 billion for the first nine months of last year with a large quantity manufactured by Chinese-owned companies for export to the US.

Associated Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Malaysia treasurer Datuk Koong Lin Loong said apart from mergers and acquisitions by private companies, Malaysia must also look at strategic alliances with other global players instead of solely relying on investment of China involving manufacturing products such as solar panels.

“We should not lose our position as one of the biggest exporters of solar panels in the world.

“The government must do something to assist and not just leave it to the private companies,” he said.

Among the steps, he said, was to adopt a ‘backward integration’ of the supply chain where raw materials do not come entirely from a single country such as China.

“This includes the transfer of technology from the Chinese manufacturer to the local companies.

“One way of going around the tariffs is that local companies become manufacturers themselves,” he said.

Koong also said Malaysia must look for alternative markets for products such as solar panels which are affected by the tariffs.

“We need to look for an alternative market apart from the US.

“This includes the European Union, Asean and the Middle East which could help solve our immediate problem.

“They need to use solar panels for their green initiatives,” he added.

Unitar International University economics professor Anthony Dass said the government should expand the Feed-In-Tariff and Net Energy Metering to create local demand for solar panels as a means to cushion the impact of a drop in export to the US due to the tariffs.

“We could also negotiate trade agreements and exemptions with the US in light of Malaysia’s contribution to the renewable energy value chain,” he said.

Malaysia Chinese Business Council director Datuk Beh Hang Kong said local manufacturers could still bring a case with the World Trade Organisation with the assistance of the Investment, Trade and Industry Ministry.

He said the action would be against anti-dumping duties as long as local manufacturers could justify that raw materials used for production were sourced locally.

He echoed similar sentiments of shifting focus to other markets instead of relying on the US.",1.73798E+12,en,0.025638275,2025-01-27 04:06:15,"['certain', 'minister', 'following', 'thursday', 'sector', 'china', 'side', 'scaling', 'buyer', 'policy', 'import', 'light', 'adviser', 'market', 'entirely', 'alliance', 'going', 'besides', 'solely', 'sunway', 'investment', 'material', 'totalling', 'taken', 'world', 'bring', 'aimed', 'cheah', 'must', 'value', 'council', 'malaysian', 'increase', 'power', 'become', 'immediate', 'seek', 'beh', 'used', 'similar', 'loan', 'chinese', 'european', 'ministry', 'impact', 'threat', 'provide', 'professor', 'agreement', 'product', 'jaya', 'manufacturing', 'manufacturer', 'first', 'reiterated', 'country', 'given', 'ensure', 'fallout', 'needed', 'large', 'offset', 'expert', 'locally', 'growing', 'rate', 'take', 'operation', 'strategic', 'biden', 'includes', 'jeffrey', 'initiative', 'affected', 'due', 'industry', 'malaysia', 'owned', 'strategise', 'shut', 'small', 'scale', 'net', 'supply', 'yeah', 'organisation', 'exporter', 'southeast', 'polysilicon', 'imposing', 'nine', 'security', 'include', 'single', 'expected', 'severe', 'perhaps', 'diversifying', 'programme', 'pushing', 'drop', 'capitalising', 'nonconventional', 'trump', 'enterprise', 'indirect', 'international', 'feedintariff', 'middle', 'transfer', 'economic', 'kong', 'key', 'recently', 'manufactured', 'shifting', 'mean', 'quantity', 'bypass', 'business', 'loong', 'player', 'form', 'possible', 'petaling', 'datuk', 'economics', 'announced', 'important', 'providing', 'investor', 'position', 'anthony', 'hub', 'december', 'lower', 'private', 'profit', 'region', 'global', 'treasurer', 'access', 'integration', 'sourced', 'effect', 'reported', 'happens', 'involving', 'help', 'government', 'halting', 'minimise', 'solve', 'took', 'aid', 'fellow', 'assist', 'local', 'chineseowned', 'still', 'back', 'adopt', 'president', 'contribution', 'leveraging', 'asean', 'including', 'particularly', 'wafer', 'sharp', 'instead', 'say', 'happening', 'justify', 'trade', 'step', 'cent', 'pull', 'use', 'chain', 'energy', 'firm', 'covid', 'already', 'look', 'month', 'last', 'chair', 'lose', 'kim', 'come', 'university', 'prof', 'union', 'lin', 'drastic', 'one', 'jan', 'diversification', 'free', 'cushion', 'technology', 'role', 'das', 'green', 'gateway', 'raw', 'something', 'play', 'among', 'decline', 'support', 'financial', 'antidumping', 'exemption', 'hang', 'procurement', 'demand', 'alternative', 'malaysianowned', 'anticipation', 'measure', 'done', 'need', 'create', 'action', 'promote', 'subjected', 'south', 'metering', 'finance', 'study', 'recent', 'allow', 'associated', 'negotiate', 'seeing', 'several', 'new', 'solar', 'better', 'per', 'biggest', 'carrying', 'donald', 'ink', 'backward', 'way', 'commerce', 'administration', 'export', 'around', 'move', 'director', 'year', 'hike', 'relying', 'unitar', 'tap', 'added', 'dip', 'asia', 'could', 'senior', 'attract', 'also', 'duty', 'production', 'regional', 'special', 'push', 'united', 'major', 'medium', 'renewable', 'panel', 'state', 'institute', 'long', 'leng', 'acquisition', 'merger', 'incentive', 'koong', 'assistance', 'case', 'tariff', 'tungsten', 'sentiment', 'job', 'leave', 'easier', 'apart', 'focus', 'capacity', 'willing', 'company', 'would', 'expand', 'east', 'towards', 'part', 'punitive', 'intending', 'foreign', 'chairmanship', 'chamber', 'problem', 'echoed', 'intervention', 'said', 'billion', 'pandemic', 'seller', 'like']",Neutral

“We want a permanent solution. Too often, we’re only given short-term answers,” Umagandhan told reporters at Taman Sri Muda.

Earlier, 40 residents boarded a bus to the Ayer Kuning state constituency in Perak to meet with Amirudin and deliver the memorandum.

Kota Kemuning assemblyman S Preakas, who was present at the protest, tried to explain the situation in Taman Sri Muda and said he had been actively assisting flood victims on the ground.

However, tensions flared when he was asked by some residents to stop speaking. Calm returned when he ended his speech.

On April 14, FMT reported Umagandhan as saying that two newly-built water pumps in the area had failed to operate properly during the recent bouts of heavy rain, resulting in floods on April 11.

He said that pump station workers told him that only the older pump was working.

Umagandhan said about 700 houses were affected, with floodwaters rising to the knee and waist level, while more were affected by shallow waters.

He claimed that there had been no visits, statements, or aid provided by government representatives or agencies, despite most of Taman Sri Muda’s residents being in the B40 group.

He also said the residents were aware that the government was planning to organise a town hall meeting next month, but “by then, we will have water up to our necks”.

Amirudin, in response, assured the residents that he understood their concerns following the recent flash flood.

“A long-term solution must be implemented urgently, and the cooperation of all parties – including the federal government – is crucial to ensure that the devastating 2021 floods do not happen again,” he said in a statement.

He said he has asked Selangor’s infrastructure and agriculture committee chairman Izham Hashim to immediately identify and implement necessary follow-up actions.

“This includes engaging directly with affected residents and reviewing the effectiveness of all flood mitigation measures undertaken by the state government,” he said.

Amirudin added that his political secretary Saifuddin Shafie will convene an emergency meeting tomorrow involving all relevant agencies, including the Shah Alam city council, and the irrigation and drainage department, to ensure urgent and coordinated response.",1.74527E+12,en,-0.371048123,2025-04-20 13:33:21,"['constituency', 'flood', 'meeting', 'following', 'boarded', 'bukit', 'failed', 'identify', 'mitigation', 'pump', 'older', 'kemuning', 'resident', 'including', 'assembly', 'secretary', 'explain', 'tried', 'assisting', 'bus', 'provided', 'cooperation', 'calm', 'emergency', 'signing', 'preakas', 'shortterm', 'present', 'crucial', 'hashim', 'demanding', 'station', 'gathered', 'waist', 'agriculture', 'fmt', 'menteri', 'demonstration', 'drainage', 'amirudin', 'besar', 'town', 'representative', 'shari', 'worker', 'mudas', 'month', 'properly', 'urgently', 'floodwaters', 'political', 'infrastructure', 'often', 'effectiveness', 'irrigation', 'must', 'council', 'added', 'hope', 'urgent', 'answer', 'determined', 'committee', 'kota', 'knee', 'also', 'understood', 'recurring', 'receives', 'official', 'area', 'tomorrow', 'resulting', 'undertaken', 'operate', 'ayer', 'working', 'protest', 'group', 'today', 'relevant', 'response', 'state', 'earlier', 'rising', 'engaging', 'assured', 'party', 'clear', 'batu', 'hold', 'krishnan', 'selangor', 'flared', 'returned', 'two', 'chairman', 'memorandum', 'peaceful', 'speech', 'muda', 'umagandhan', 'situation', 'however', 'visit', 'tension', 'statement', 'coordinated', 'city', 'agency', 'reporter', 'federal', 'campaign', 'water', 'reviewing', 'necessary', 'house', 'planning', 'neighbourhood', 'actively', 'happen', 'perak', 'saifuddin', 'lapan', 'measure', 'newlybuilt', 'taman', 'there', 'neck', 'action', 'deliver', 'given', 'ensure', 'heavy', 'alam', 'hall', 'despite', 'victim', 'reported', 'claimed', 'asked', 'implemented', 'involving', 'organise', 'ground', 'made', 'longterm', 'would', 'saying', 'rain', 'meet', 'solution', 'recent', 'shallow', 'concern', 'speaking', 'want', 'government', 'shah', 'spokesman', 'directly', 'aid', 'aware', 'byelection', 'ended', 'selangors', 'next', 'immediately', 'problem', 'followup', 'includes', 'sri', 'convene', 'affected', 'flash', 'april', 'plaguing', 'department', 'said', 'level', 'shafie', 'currently', 'stop', 'devastating', 'bout', 'submit', 'told', 'assemblyman', 'kuning', 'implement', 'permanent', 'izham']",Neutral

The special Boeing 737-73Q (BBJ) aircraft carrying the president landed at the Royal Malaysian Air Force base here at 5.50 am.

Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability Minister Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad was present to greet Prabowo’s delegation, which included several Indonesian Cabinet ministers and senior government officials.

Upon his arrival, Prabowo inspected a guard of honour consisting of 28 officers and personnel from the First Battalion Royal Ranger Regiment (Ceremonial) under the command of Capt Muhammad Syafiq Najmi Mazlan.

According to Wisma Putra, the State Visit reflects the strong and special bond of friendship between Malaysia and Indonesia and is also the first State Visit by a foreign Head of State since the installation of His Majesty Sultan Ibrahim as King of Malaysia.

The visit includes a State Welcoming Ceremony, followed by an audience with His Majesty Sultan Ibrahim at Istana Negara. His Majesty will also graciously host a State Banquet in honour of the President and his delegation.

In the afternoon, Prabowo is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim to exchange views on bilateral cooperation and regional and international issues of mutual interest at the Petronas Twin Tower in Kuala Lumpur.

As close neighbours with strong ties and founding members of Asean, this state visit reflects the commitment of both countries to elevate bilateral relations to a higher level for the prosperity and progress of both nations and the region at large.

Malaysia and Indonesia’s strategic ties encompass comprehensive cooperation across a wide range of areas, including politics, economy, defence, interconnectivity, education, and socio-culture.

From January to November last year, total bilateral trade between the two countries reached RM106.06 billion, an increase from RM101.99 billion during the same period in 2023.

In 2023, Indonesia was Malaysia’s eighth-largest trading partner globally and the third-largest within Asean, with a total trade volume of RM111.21 billion.

“We know about global warming,” International Ski Federation (FIS) sustainability director Susanna Sieff told AFP. “We have to struggle with this. And let me say we are the first victim.”

For the first 10 days of the championships, skiers flew down a strip of artificial snow on a mountainside otherwise completely green in the middle of winter.

The Austrian Meteorological Institute said that before Feb 14, hardly a single snowflake fell in the country in February and that Januar y was on average 2°C warmer than the average for that month from 1991 to 2020.

“Being on site, it is quite a sad picture that there is basically no natural snow at the moment,” Moritz Nachtschatt, from the Protect Our Winters (POW) association, told AFP, before Feb 14’s fall covered Saalbach’s embarrassing nakedness. “It’s the beginning of February. There is a lot less snow than 20 years ago.”

POW wrote a letter two years ago signed by 142 skiers, including stars such as Mikaela Shiffrin, asking FIS to step up its efforts, because their sport was “in danger”.

Saalbach, at an altitude of 1,000m, is particularly threatened. “Ski World Cups will be possible in the future, but a place like Saalbach could have difficulties,” said Nachtschatt. “Anything below 1,500m, I’m quite sure, won’t be possible anymore in 20 years.” Sieff, whose position was created by FIS two years ago, agrees. “There will be less venues to do this and this is a reality we know, for the lower ski resort,” she said. “We have also to work with ski resorts higher up that are our future.”

Saalbach’s organisers said they are organising a green singlesite event, emphasising sustainability and cheap communal public transport.

“This is a positive,” said Ursula Bittner of Greenpeace Austria, who nevertheless called for more “transparency” from the organisers regarding the “green label”. She also said the FIS calendar posed a problem.

Alpine, Nordic and freestyle skiers and snowboarders spend their winters criss-crossing the globe to some 330 FIS World Cup events.

But as the planet warms, more and more often they arrive at an event to find it cancelled for lack of snow. Snow uncertainty is also a problem for resorts trying to attract hobby skiers.

“The season is becoming less reliable, especially at the beginning and at the end,” said University of Innsbruck’s Prof Robert Steiger who specialises in climate change.

“The snow comes later and you’re able to open the resort later than you’re used to and you have to terminate the season earlier than it used to be.”

Competitions are not in danger in the medium term because artificial snow makes it possible to stage races.

“The effort to produce snow is increasing,” he said, adding that was “the most obvious consequence of a changed climate”.

“Then the question is what do we do if there is no natural snow at all?” he asked. “Conditions are good for skiing and for the competition but the pictures are not as we would like to have it, we have those white strips in the green or brown landscape.”

With snow-making technology, said Steiger: “Most of the resorts would be able to remain reliable at least for the next three decades or so. The question then is, can you afford it?

“Surveys show that skiers want to have snow and they want to go skiing. They do not want to switch to a different kind of activity.”

Bittner wants people to be able to carry on skiing.

“We shouldn’t underestimate the importance of having some events, having people enjoying the sport and looking at the professionals,” she said. “Life is also about life. People come together and celebrate.” — AFP",1.74079E+12,en,-0.199023068,2025-02-28 00:31:11,"['resort', 'stage', 'switch', 'basically', 'later', 'letter', 'average', 'celebrate', 'austrian', 'work', 'completely', 'feb', 'sustainability', 'including', 'particularly', 'white', 'race', 'struggle', 'say', 'mikaela', 'strip', 'warms', 'created', 'federation', 'robert', 'austria', 'altitude', 'snowmaking', 'condition', 'reality', 'sad', 'organiser', 'season', 'decade', 'ago', 'step', 'single', 'pow', 'nachtschatt', 'skier', 'uncertainty', 'nevertheless', 'asking', 'steiger', 'embarrassing', 'snowboarder', 'kind', 'month', 'facing', 'crisscrossing', 'director', 'world', 'year', 'mountainside', 'often', 'change', 'cup', 'moment', 'term', 'flew', 'communal', 'specialises', 'fis', 'covered', 'wont', 'question', 'underestimate', 'hardly', 'three', 'together', 'could', 'event', 'come', 'snow', 'international', 'university', 'threatened', 'prof', 'terminate', 'middle', 'picture', 'attract', 'show', 'protect', 'enjoying', 'warming', 'also', 'warm', 'venue', 'increasing', 'men', 'good', 'skiing', 'freestyle', 'sport', 'anything', 'posed', 'regarding', 'different', 'afp', 'especially', 'end', 'used', 'emphasising', 'medium', 'sure', 'association', 'know', 'institute', 'quite', 'place', 'spend', 'hobby', 'possible', 'earlier', 'positive', 'called', 'giant', 'otherwise', 'nakedness', 'less', 'globe', 'fall', 'consequence', 'issue', 'changed', 'make', 'winter', 'technology', 'two', 'nordic', 'open', 'position', 'dusting', 'youre', 'fell', 'green', 'calendar', 'produce', 'ski', 'natural', 'briefly', 'meteorological', 'agrees', 'life', 'lower', 'bittner', 'future', 'arrive', 'ursula', 'least', 'shiffrin', 'landscape', 'looking', 'organising', 'trying', 'transparency', 'wrote', 'effort', 'reliable', 'planet', 'survey', 'snowflake', 'slalom', 'star', 'global', 'adding', 'first', 'saalbach', 'higher', 'championship', 'professional', 'carry', 'country', 'becoming', 'obvious', 'danger', 'afford', 'januar', 'activity', 'hostile', 'anymore', 'able', 'moritz', 'brown', 'label', 'people', 'lot', 'victim', 'asked', 'climate', 'disguising', 'would', 'remain', 'shouldnt', 'let', 'site', 'public', 'want', 'lack', 'february', 'singlesite', 'sieff', 'saalbachs', 'greenpeace', 'day', 'artificial', 'alpine', 'environment', 'find', 'whose', 'valley', 'next', 'importance', 'problem', 'cancelled', 'competition', 'susanna', 'said', 'increasingly', 'beginning', 'innsbruck', 'signed', 'difficulty', 'told', 'cheap', 'transport', 'like', 'warmer']",Neutral

The average LNG price for June delivery into north-east Asia was at $11.50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), estimated industry sources, down from $11.80/mmBtu last week but still at its lowest levels since mid-May.

""Lower Asian LNG prices this week prompted opportunistic buying by some East Asian importers, while supply disruptions at export projects in Australia and Brunei provided support to otherwise falling regional fundamentals,"" said Rystad senior analyst Masanori Odaka, adding that Korea Gas Corporation, Taiwan's CPC Corporation and a Chinese importer had recently made spot purchases.

""While some Asian importers took advantage of the dip to make purchases, others adopted a wait and-see approach as they evaluated turbulent market conditions amid sufficient storage levels.""

Inpex Corp, which operates Australia's Ichthys LNG, said the rate of production at the plant has decreased temporarily, without specifying why or when full production would resume.

In Southeast Asia, industry and trade sources said that both Malaysia's Bintulu LNG complex and the Brunei LNG plant were also experiencing production issues, with Brunei LNG cancelling a tender issued this month for a June delivered cargo.

Despite production outages in the Pacific, the inter-basin arbitrage has held closed for prompt deliveries, with only one carrier diverting in the mid-Atlantic towards Asia on April 16, said Martin Senior, head of LNG pricing at commodities pricing agency Argus.

""Asian buyers have not since made a significant move to compete for Atlantic basin cargoes since the production outages,"" he said.

In Europe, S&P Global Commodity Insights assessed its daily North West Europe LNG Marker (NWM) price benchmark for cargoes delivered in June on an ex-ship (DES) basis at $11.124/mmBtu on April 16, a $0.735/mmBtu discount to the June gas price at the Dutch TTF hub.

export,The US Remained World’s Largest Liquefied Natural Gas Exporter In 2024 – Analysis,1.74519E+12,Eurasia Review,www.eurasiareview.com,https://news.google.com/read/CBMiugFBVV95cUxNTTBNTVJtSzVzOU1FNWxZQUZhQThRQ2NGd0pXWFhfVzR2Mi1GWDB4NXFQSjdKTzRUdHdUSGZPTmZ6alB4WFpobmF1bGxBQnVkRUJqd25JWGROWHk0VW5LbnNOcVk2VmNSUG9KRmhMNEc5SjV4QWQxVmcyZExRaDFTS2RMQUNiOUd3b2U0RzZsOUV4d3d1NkxFU3pYa0ZhY05jd1NyaHNXUFpPVko5d2tVNnA5UFlTTXBYd0E?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://www.eurasiareview.com/21042025-the-us-remained-worlds-largest-liquefied-natural-gas-exporter-in-2024-analysis/,"By EIA

The United States exported 11.9 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in 2024, remaining the world’s largest LNG exporter.

LNG exports from Australia and Qatar—the world’s two next-largest LNG exporters—have remained relatively stable over the last five years (2020–24); their exports have ranged from 10.2 Bcf/d to 10.7 Bcf/d annually, according to data from Cedigaz. Russia and Malaysia have been the fourth- and fifth-largest LNG exporters globally since 2019. In 2024, LNG exports from Russia averaged 4.4 Bcf/d, and exports from Malaysia averaged 3.7 Bcf/d.

U.S. LNG exports remained essentially flat compared with 2023 mainly because of several unplanned outages at existing LNG export facilities, lower natural gas consumption in Europe, and very limited new LNG export capacity additions since 2022. In December 2024, Plaquemines LNG Phase 1 shipped its first export cargo, becoming the eighth U.S. LNG export facility in service. We estimate that utilization of LNG export capacity across the other seven U.S. LNG terminals operating in 2024 averaged 104% of nominal capacity and 86% of peak capacity, unchanged from the previous year. While Europe (including Türkiye) remained the primary destination for U.S. LNG exports in 2024, accounting for 53% (6.3 Bcf/d) of the total exports, the share of U.S. LNG exports to Asia increased from 26% (3.1 Bcf/d) in 2023 to 33% (4.0 Bcf/d) in 2024. U.S. LNG exports to other regions, including the Middle East, North Africa, and Latin America, also increased last year and accounted for 14% (1.6 Bcf/d) of total exports, compared with 8% (0.9 Bcf/d) in 2023.

In 2024, U.S. natural gas exports to Europe decreased by 19% (1.5 Bcf/d), mostly to countries in the EU and the UK. U.S. LNG exports increased only to Türkiye and Greece in 2024—by 0.2 Bcf/d and 0.1 Bcf/d, respectively, compared with 2023. Türkiye imported more U.S. LNG compared with the prior year mainly to offset a decline in imports from other countries, such as Egypt and Russia. U.S. LNG exports to other EU countries and the UK decreased by 24% (1.7 Bcf/d) compared with 2023, primarily because of lower natural gas consumption and high storage inventories following the mild 2023–24 winter. At the same time, LNG import capacity in the EU and the UK expanded by more than 40% between 2021 and 2024 and will continue to grow in 2025 once new and expanded regasification facilities in Croatia, Cyprus, and Italy come online.

As in 2023, the Netherlands, France, and the UK imported the most U.S. LNG among countries in Europe, accounting for a combined 46% (2.9 Bcf/d) of the regional total. Since Germany started LNG imports in December 2022, U.S. LNG exports to Germany have grown and averaged 0.6 Bcf/d in both 2023 and 2024. However, in early 2025, Germany reduced its regasification capacity by terminating a charter for one of its floating storage and regasification units, citing high operational costs.

In 2024, countries in Asia imported 33% (4.0 Bcf/d) of total U.S. LNG exports. Among countries in Asia, Japan, South Korea, India, and China imported the most U.S. LNG—a combined 76% (3.0 Bcf/d). U.S. LNG imports increased the most in India—by 0.2 Bcf/d. Other countries in Asia imported 24% (1.0 Bcf/d) of U.S LNG.

In other regions, Egypt—a natural gas producer and LNG exporter—imported 0.3 Bcf/d of LNG from the United States, its first U.S. LNG imports since 2018. In recent years, Egypt’s domestic natural gas consumption, particularly in summer months, exceeded available supply and turned Egypt from an exporter to an importer of natural gas during several months of the year.

Indonesian people and students had been waiting since morning to welcome Prabowo.

President Prabowo arrived at the hotel at around 07:00 local time. Four Indonesian children wearing traditional clothes greeted him enthusiastically while saying, ""Welcome Mr. President to Kuala Lumpur"".

President Prabowo returned their greetings with a smile. ""Thank you, thank you all. You are all very brave. Thank you for picking me up early in the morning,"" said Prabowo as quoted from the official statement of the Press, Media, and Information Bureau of the Presidential Secretariat.

The enthusiasm of the students was seen when some had been waiting since morning. Junior high and high school students named Fadil and Ziva had been at the location since 05:00 am.

""We've been here since 5 o'clock, to meet Mr. Prabowo, to welcome his presence,"" said Fadil.

Meanwhile, Ziva, who was standing a bit away from the main crowd, was still happy to be able to see President Prabowo in person. ""Very happy, but we didn't get to greet him because we were standing very far behind. So just seeing him was enough to be grateful,"" she said.

Syafiq, an elementary school student who also joined the welcoming, said he was happy to be able to meet President Prabowo in person. ""I want to meet Mr. Prabowo, because this week is a holiday, the whole of Malaysia is off. Hopefully Mr. Prabowo will be a good president and be responsible for all of its implementation,"" he said.

Not only students, the community also has high hopes for President Prabowo. Lina, one of the representatives of the Indonesian community who was present, expressed her happiness at the President's arrival.

""We are very excited because President Prabowo has just been elected. Of course we have high hopes for the President so that education in Indonesia will be better and all aspects in Indonesia can also be better,"" said Lina.

Lina also said that President Prabowo's arrival could provide new enthusiasm for Indonesian citizens in Malaysia. ""Happy, he greeted us, the teachers, the students, exciting, very happy,"" she added.

In addition to students and the public, a number of ministers were also seen who had already been at the location to welcome Prabowo's arrival. They were the Minister of Primary and Secondary Education Abdul Mu'ti, the Minister of Protection of Indonesian Migrant Workers/Head of BP2MI Abdul Kadir Karding, the Minister of Trade Budi Santoso, and the Minister of Investment and Downstream/Head of BKPM Rosan Roeslani.

President Prabowo Subianto continued his overseas official trip to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, from New Delhi after attending the celebration of the 76th Republic Day of India on January 26, 2025.

Prabowo went to Malaysia to attend the awarding of the Darjah Kerabat Johor Yang Amat Dihormati Pangkat Pertama (D.K I Johor) to President Prabowo. This award is one of the highest honors given by the Sultanate of Johor to the country's leader.

In addition to receiving the award, President Prabowo is also scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in Malaysia.

The Investment, Trade and Industry Minister said this includes upgrading the Asean Trade In Goods Agreement (Atiga), continuing discussions on the Digital Economic Framework Agreement (Defa) and Timor Leste's membership into the grouping.

""I am optimistic that we will be able to conclude Atiga by March as there are countries ready to sign the agreements. However, with regards to Defa, we need to finetune some matters as each country will have their own issues. I have mentioned before that each country in Asean are different in their per capita gross domestic product (GDP),"" he said, stressing that talks on the digital economy should be fair for all member states.

Tengku Zafrul, who was speaking to the media during the 31st Asean Economic Ministers' Retreat here on Thursday (Feb 27), admitted that it was harder to navigate now due to the landscape of geopolitical challenges facing the world today.

""However it is important for this bloc of Asean countries to band together to face all the potential challenges that may come including addressing and mitigating them together,"" he added.

On tariffs potentially imposed by the US, he said that it would be discussed on Friday alongside matters on trade, technology security and supply chain security.

Tengku Zafrul said that whatever issues that are raised or discussed would need to get consensus from all members to ensure Asean moves together.

On some countries' protectionism policies, Tengku Zafrul said that it was natural for countries to be protective of their industries that they feel were not mature or ready to face fair competition.

""Asean will have to continue to see how to mitigate this by integrating and deepening its own trade and investment collaboration within the Asean framework.

""One area that we think we can work stronger is through the Defa to make it more inclusive and to ensure that not just the big players benefit from this Asean integration,"" he said, adding that they also hoped to discuss not just about protective areas in trade and goods but also on services.

He added that there was more protection which exists in the services sector rather than in the trade sector and this should be addressed in the long term.

Asked about talks that the US and China tensions will benefit Asean, Tengku Zafrul said that he was ‘not in total agreement’ as anything that happens between China and US would have ramifications for Asean.

""If you look at the two global economies, they represent close to 40-45% of the total global GDP. So if the pie shrinks it will affect Asean,"" he said, adding that trade would be impacted if there is any trade or economic growth decline or even growth becomes moderate.

He added on the issue of foreign direct investment (FDI), there could be some truth for the time being as since the geopolitical tensions, there has been a global FDI decline but FDI into Asean was still in positive territory.

""But to sustain this, we still need global economic growth because at the end of the day, it is a function of demand and supply and when demand is affected, so of course supply will also be affected along with investments,"" he said, adding that Asean being an open economy could also experience a redirection of trade where supply chain would be realigned and redesigned along with the geopolitical lines.

""So again Asean will be put on the spot to make a choice but we of course as a non-aligned movement will continue to be neutral in our position but being neutral means that we must navigate this carefully,"" he added.

Taking advantage of the $1 billion export markets for South Australian businesses, is a new trade and investment expert Nadzirah Ali who will be based out of the Austrade office in Kuala Lumpur.

Malaysia is South Australia’s third largest export partner and is also an influential trade hub in Southeast Asia – one of the fastest growing regions in the world with increasing global economic influence.

Ms Ali will work closely with the South Australian Department of State Development (DSD) to support trade missions, export initiatives and promote South Australia as an investment destination for Malaysian businesses.

Before joining DSD, Ms Ali was the inward investment lead at the United Kingdom’s Department for Business and Trade – based at the British High Commission in Kuala Lumpur – where she played a key role in promoting commercial opportunities and driving investment into the UK.

Prior to that, she was responsible for developing the UK Department for Business and Trade infrastructure trade strategy for Malaysia to support and increase UK exports and investment into Malaysia.

Ms Ali has exposure through these roles, into tech, agriculture, renewables, life sciences and more.

Malaysia is an important economic partner for South Australia, driven by strong trade, investment and educational ties.

The country is a major importer of South Australian metals, food and wine, while also serving as a significant hub for global supply chains, particularly in manufacturing, electronics and digital industries.

Refined copper is the South Australia’s largest export to Malaysia, valued at $761.1 million. Sheep meat exports, now the state’s second largest export to Malaysia, rose 45 per cent to $58.7 million in 2024.

Ms Ali’s presence bolsters the Department of State Development’s Southeast Asian trade offices. She will support Southeast Asian regional director, Ms Natalya Twohill, based in Singapore, and the State Government’s trade and investment special snvoy to Singapore and Southeast Asia, Mr Martin Haese.

export,Cambodia struggles to harvest its agricultural potential while Vietnam reaps the benefits,1.7407E+12,East Asia Forum,https://eastasiaforum.org/2025/02/28/cambodia-struggles-to-harvest-its-agricultural-potential-while-vietnam-reaps-the-benefits/,https://news.google.com/read/CBMixgFBVV95cUxPZ3l1U1RETHZsYzZSSkdmMTNGbElRY1pja2laMDl6UG95ZlNvUXp6Y3hoeUd0RmJTSk9zaGI1V05KMkdaZ0NyNldyemNncXlNdmFRNnZKMVJfYW96S3MtemlfUjFYa1lPeURUSGctc08zdUt5OVplbW9IbGJNX1BUc3g0N0hONUtOVzZHZGljc18wZlpLVlpVdVV5UUNwSzBXX3lFVDFUekxJRVk0UnktTE14MkswNEYzc2tVVnIyWDhNRU9GNFE?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://eastasiaforum.org/2025/02/28/cambodia-struggles-to-harvest-its-agricultural-potential-while-vietnam-reaps-the-benefits/,"Listen to this article

Cambodia’s trade with Vietnam has increased significantly, with a noticeable reduction in the bilateral trade deficit over time. But the relationship remains imbalanced, with Cambodia heavily reliant on exporting raw materials while importing higher-value goods. This dynamic has left Cambodia unable to fully capitalise on its agricultural potential, putting its farmers and economy at a disadvantage.

While ASEAN promotes trade among its members through initiatives like the ASEAN Economic Community, small states like Cambodia struggle to benefit due to limited production and export capacity.

From Cambodia’s perspective, ASEAN is standing by as Vietnam imports raw materials from Cambodia, rather than helping the Kingdom develop its own agro-processing industry. From January to November 2024, trade between Cambodia and Vietnam reached US$7.08 billion, a 20.6 per cent increase, making Vietnam Cambodia’s second-largest export market behind the United States. Cambodia’s exports to Vietnam reached US$3.29 billion, up 26.3 per cent, mostly consisting of cashews, corn, bananas, mangoes, tobacco, rice and rubber. Vietnam’s main exports to Cambodia, worth US$3.79 billion, include building supplies, machinery, fuel, electronics and electrical equipment, fertilisers, animal feed, vegetables and fruits.

Cambodian farmers produce agricultural products, but these goods are often unprofitable due to low selling prices and high production costs of fertilisers, fuel and machinery. Vietnam benefits from Cambodia’s limited industrial capacity, importing raw materials at lower prices and processing them into finished goods for export to global markets like Europe and China under Vietnam’s own branding.

Rice is Cambodia’s primary agricultural product, occupying nearly 70 per cent of cultivated land, with subsidiary and industrial crops at 19 per cent, rubber at 7 per cent and permanent crops at 4 per cent. The country has significant potential for high-value agricultural exports due to its fertile land and favourable climate. Government initiatives have focused on enhancing productivity and diversifying exports towards higher-value products. Although agriculture’s contribution to GDP has decreased from 50 per cent in the early 1990s to about 22 per cent in 2023, it still accounts for nearly 40 per cent of employment.

But the Kingdom heavily relies on sourcing fertilisers from neighbouring countries, including Vietnam (US$207 million), Thailand (US$139 million), China (US$12 million), Japan (US$5.61 million) and South Korea (US$1.61 million). Despite this, farmers and other individuals continue to encounter difficulties, such as the rising cost of fertiliser and high living expenses.

Cambodia is primarily reliant on raw material exports, limiting its agricultural benefits. Farmers grow lucrative commodities such as cassava, rubber and cashews, but they are frequently exported to Vietnam for processing. In 2022–23, Cambodia exported over 3.5 million tonnes of paddy rice to Vietnam, where it is processed and then exported to international markets. These include Europe and some ASEAN countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia — Vietnam’s largest rice export markets.

Cambodia has enough rice mills capable of meeting international export standards, but lacks capital to purchase rice grains for stocking and production and struggles to reduce processing costs, particularly in transportation. Cambodian farmers encounter challenges such as low yields due to outdated techniques, limited access to advanced technology and high production costs. As a result some farming households in Takeo, Kandal, Prey Veng and Svay Rieng have decided to rent their farmland to Southwestern Vietnamese farmers for rice cultivation.

Cambodia faces challenges in job creation, income growth, economic diversification and industrial development, largely because it relies heavily on exporting raw materials. Developing value-added industries, such as packaging and food processing, remains a significant underexplored opportunity. In 2024, 95 per cent of raw cashew nuts were exported, leaving only 5 per cent for domestic processing. This leads to significant value loss for farmers, traders and local communities.

Cambodia’s limited domestic processing capacity allows Vietnam to dominate the value-added stage of its agricultural exports. This situation is further compounded by high export costs and stringent entry requirements for processed agricultural goods in global markets. Electricity is a crucial input for processing, yet Cambodia has one of the highest costs of electricity in the region. The education system also lacks specialised training in food technology, quality control and agro-industrial engineering.

To develop a strong agro-processing industry, Cambodia must reduce electricity and logistics costs to boost local competitiveness. Investment in modern food processing technology would improve efficiency and product quality, opening doors to international markets. Developing a skilled workforce in agro-industrial engineering is essential for sustaining technological advancements. Expanding financial access through targeted incentives and low-interest loans can attract investment in processing facilities. There is also a need to strengthen the country’s branding and export strategies, shifting from raw exports to high-value agricultural products. These actions are expected to boost industrial growth, generate employment opportunities and consolidate Cambodia’s position in global trade.

Cambodia’s growing trade with Vietnam presents both challenges and opportunities. As ASEAN removes regional trade barriers, the Kingdom is losing its competitive advantage in agricultural products to Vietnam, leaving citizens facing high expenses and low incomes.

Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim hosted Shoigu at his office, and the Russian former defence chief who is now secretary of Moscow's Security Council was also due to meet with Malaysian Defence Minister Mohamed Khaled Nordin.

T op Russian security official Sergei Shoigu held talks on defence and security with Malaysia's leader on Thursday, as Moscow seeks to boost ties with Southeast Asia after its sudden rapprochement with the United States under President Donald Trump.

Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim hosted Shoigu at his office, and the Russian former defence chief who is now secretary of Moscow's Security Council was also due to meet with Malaysian Defence Minister Mohamed Khaled Nordin.

""Our discussions focused on several significant matters pertaining to the relationship between our two countries, among others education, security and defence issues,"" Anwar said on X.

Russia's state news agency TASS said Shoigu read out a message from President Vladimir Putin in which he ""conveyed his warm greetings and emphasised that Russian-Malaysian relations have traditionally been friendy"".

""We will be discussing space and nuclear energy,"" he added.

Shoigu, seen as influential in the decision to send Russian troops into Ukraine in 2022, also met with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto and Defence Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin in Jakarta this week.

Analysts told AFP that with the recent improvement of ties between Washington and Moscow, countries are free to engage Russia with no fear of US reprisals due to sanctions imposed after the Ukraine invasion by Trump's predecessor Joe Biden.

""It is of great strategic significance as the visit signals a critical turning point in Russia's eastward pivot to engaging Southeast Asia,"" said Mustafa Izzuddin, who teaches international relations at the Islamic University of Indonesia.

""Putin's Russia sees Indonesia and Malaysia as twin strategic gateways to enhance the country's engagement with the wider Southeast Asian region... due to deepening bilateral trust stemming from the neutral stances of Indonesia and Malaysia on the Russo-Ukranian War.""

Oh Ei Sun, of the Pacific Research Centre of Malaysia, said that Indonesia and Malaysia are key regional players and are also among the biggest buyers of Russian military equipment.

PETALING JAYA – Occupational injury involving the hand, including the loss and permanent disablement of fingers, has been rising across various industries nationwide.

This prompted the Occupational Safety and Health Department (DOSH) to step in to address the matter amid growing concerns.

DOSH deputy director-general (occupational safety) Bahrudin Mamat said the upward and worrying trend of cases involving finger injuries warranted an urgent need for stricter workplace safety regulations and regular training to prevent such incidents.

He said the figures were alarming with 4,651 cases reported nationwide in 2021.

The number of cases shot up to 6,788 in 2022 and 7,109 in 2023.

Bahrudin said local workers contributed to the bulk of the cases.

He said apart from having their fingers severed, there were also cases of serious injury, leading to permanent disability.

“These affected workers lost the function of their fingers, rendering them unfit for regular duties.

“The manufacturing, agriculture, services and food industries were among the four sectors with the highest number of cases,” he said.

Bahrudin said the sub-industries topping the list with the most finger-related accidents were timber processing, airline ground handling, steel milling, glove production and commercial bakeries with each seeing more than a dozen mishaps every year.

However, he said they could not ascertain if any of the cases were deliberately created with an aim to seek compensation.

“We have not identified any such case of a worker doing it on purpose for compensation. Based on our investigations, it is often due to negligence and failure to observe safety procedures,” he said.

Bahrudin also said many cases of finger loss or injury occurred when a worker attempted to manually sort out processes when automation malfunctioned.

He said campaigns and intervention by DOSH to address the issue last year had brought positive and significant improvements.

While the latest 2024 statistics are in the midst of being compiled by the department, preliminary findings showed a decline in the number of finger and hand-related accidents.

Bahrudin said various occupational safety campaigns targeted specifically at the type of accidents that are rampant are being planned for launch this year to further safeguard workers from preventable harm at their workplace.

“We encourage self-regulation of safety at workplaces and for employers to be proactive in taking essential steps to avoid mishaps.

“The top 50 companies with the highest number of occupational casualties nationwide are closely monitored with regular inspections at the premises,” he added.

However, Bahrudin said with over 30,000 cases of accidents reported across the country, their manpower would be stretched.

“If a fatal accident occurs, we will definitely step in to conduct a thorough investigation.

“It is compulsory for employers to notify us of any accident case that requires a worker to go on sick leave for more than four days,” he said.

“On top of this, employers are also required to submit an annual report, declaring the total number of accidents at their premises throughout the year, regardless of the severity.

“This enables us to closely monitor, intervene and implement stronger protective measures for the safety of workers,” he added.

Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act 1994 (OSHA) or Act 514, the responsibility of ensuring workplace safety and health lies with the employer or the owner of a business.

“When a job is to be performed, it is crucial for risk assessment to be undertaken by employers. They need to analyse the risks and dangers their workers could be exposed to and take necessary steps to minimise them,” he said.

Bahrudin said workers had the right to refuse resuming their duties if they find their workspace was unsafe.

He said they might step away from the site and notify their employer of the hazards.

“If the employer does not take remedial steps to address the risk, the worker can file a report with DOSH. We will then take the appropriate action,” he said.

On the other hand, Bahrudin said workers who did not adhere to safety measures or procedures accordingly could face action, including being charged in court for negligence.

“There have been several such cases in the past where errant workers were hauled up to court,” he said.",1.74527E+12,en,-0.580559671,2025-04-21 03:17:45,"['lost', 'four', 'deputy', 'observe', 'glove', 'sick', 'brought', 'dozen', 'sector', 'osha', 'across', 'mishap', 'serious', 'declaring', 'subindustries', 'disablement', 'including', 'inspection', 'injury', 'created', 'adhere', 'stricter', 'timber', 'negligence', 'ensuring', 'unfit', 'appropriate', 'crucial', 'contributed', 'finding', 'severed', 'step', 'fatal', 'safeguard', 'finger', 'agriculture', 'past', 'manpower', 'bahrudin', 'closely', 'sort', 'charged', 'matter', 'act', 'face', 'owner', 'worker', 'performed', 'notify', 'protective', 'court', 'food', 'last', 'avoid', 'occurs', 'fingerrelated', 'warranted', 'casualty', 'highest', 'nationwide', 'year', 'throughout', 'often', 'airline', 'required', 'directorgeneral', 'stronger', 'planned', 'requires', 'annual', 'type', 'urgent', 'essential', 'added', 'procedure', 'harm', 'responsibility', 'errant', 'number', 'could', 'taking', 'preliminary', 'compulsory', 'also', 'based', 'improvement', 'duty', 'address', 'production', 'steel', 'function', 'hand', 'seek', 'trend', 'accident', 'prompted', 'ascertain', 'malfunctioned', 'handrelated', 'severity', 'hauled', 'occurred', 'working', 'business', 'drive', 'lie', 'regular', 'regardless', 'prevent', 'incident', 'latest', 'rising', 'worrying', 'loss', 'analyse', 'petaling', 'significant', 'might', 'deliberately', 'positive', 'bulk', 'remedial', 'issue', 'workspace', 'upward', 'hazard', 'safety', 'automation', 'rendering', 'however', 'case', 'purpose', 'accordingly', 'among', 'selfregulation', 'occupational', 'decline', 'campaign', 'specifically', 'read', 'preventable', 'necessary', 'stretched', 'figure', 'jaya', 'intervene', 'job', 'milling', 'leave', 'rampant', 'leading', 'premise', 'health', 'measure', 'manufacturing', 'service', 'need', 'mamat', 'list', 'attempted', 'bakery', 'file', 'country', 'compiled', 'assessment', 'apart', 'unsafe', 'action', 'amid', 'commercial', 'identified', 'danger', 'every', 'alarming', 'dosh', 'reported', 'definitely', 'involving', 'report', 'company', 'ground', 'manually', 'exposed', 'compensation', 'undertaken', 'would', 'right', 'total', 'regulation', 'site', 'proactive', 'concern', 'awareness', 'aim', 'failure', 'encourage', 'monitor', 'growing', 'day', 'midst', 'take', 'targeted', 'minimise', 'away', 'find', 'showed', 'processing', 'seeing', 'local', 'disability', 'investigation', 'top', 'affected', 'intervention', 'monitored', 'due', 'april', 'conduct', 'various', 'industry', 'department', 'employer', 'thorough', 'said', 'training', 'many', 'enables', 'several', 'workplace', 'shot', 'handling', 'refuse', 'topping', 'launch', 'risk', 'process', 'resuming', 'submit', 'statistic', 'implement', 'permanent']",Negative

by AUFA MARDHIAH

MALAYSIA and China have signed 31 memoranda of understanding (MoUs) and agreements during Chinese President Xi Jinping’s three-day state visit to Kuala Lumpur, reinforcing bilateral ties across a broad spectrum of sectors including technology, trade, defence, infrastructure and cultural cooperation.

The visit, which took place from April 15-17, marked Xi’s second visit to Malaysia after 12 years. It also coincided with the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries, forming part of his wider tour of South-East Asia.

In a speech at the official state banquet on April 16, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim described the occasion as “a reaffirmation of a relationship grounded in respect, enriched by history and sustained by a shared sense of purpose.”

He said that while the world may have changed over the past decade, “the friendship between Malaysia and China has remained firm and steadfast — renewed through dialogue and affirmed through action.”

Among the agreements signed was a memorandum to jointly promote the Global Security Initiative, along with notes exchanged under China’s Global Civilisation and Global Development frameworks. Both countries also agreed to establish a Joint Foreign and Defence Dialogue and implement mutual visa exemptions for holders of public affairs and ordinary passports.

Trade and industrial collaboration featured prominently in the engagements. The Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry (MTI) signed MoUs with China’s Ministry of Commerce to enhance cooperation in trade in services and upgrade the “Two Countries, Twin Parks” programme. Another agreement focused on standardisation between the regulatory bodies of both nations.

Transport and agriculture also saw renewed cooperation. The Ministry of Transport (MOT) signed an MoU with China’s National Railway Administration to strengthen collaboration in the railway sector.

Meanwhile, a protocol was agreed to facilitate the export of fresh coconut fruit from Malaysia to China under the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security.

Technology and science were also key areas of engagement. MoUs were signed to establish joint laboratories in emerging technologies and to cooperate on the Beidou Navigation Satellite System. Additional agreements covered artificial intelligence (AI), digital economy initiatives and intellectual property (IP) protection.

In his speech, Anwar expressed strong support for China’s global frameworks, including the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), calling them “a new lease on hope” at a time when multilateralism is under strain.

“They speak not of rivalry, but of renewal,” he said.

Anwar also issued a pointed critique of rising economic unilateralism, warning that “market access is being weaponised” and describing the current global environment as a “retreat into economic tribalism.”

He urged global powers to “pause, reflect and step away from the precipice,” stressing that trade should be a shared endeavour rather than a zero-sum game.

Cultural and educational cooperation also featured in the MoUs signed, including the establishment of a China-Malaysia AI and new materials lab between Universiti Malaya (UM) and Peking University, and a cooperation agreement on interfaith dialogue between Confucianism and Islam.

Anwar framed these exchanges as essential for promoting harmony over conflict.

“Respect for difference is not a barrier to harmony, but its precondition,” he said.

On media and tourism, the Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture (MOTAC) secured three agreements with Xinhua News Agency and China Media Group (CMG), while the Ministry of Communications and agencies such as Radio Televisyen Malaysia (RTM), National Film Development Corp Malaysia (FINAS) and Bernama expanded partnerships for news and content production.

In addition to the 26 officially announced deals, five more were announced to the media. These include the formation of the China-Malaysia International Institute for Advanced Studies, a digital transformation initiative between Malaysia Digital Economy Corp (MDEC) and Zhejiang University, and new collaborations involving Star Media Group, Malaysian think tanks and friendship associations.

Anwar added a reaffirmation of Malaysia’s friendship with China, citing a Malay proverb often echoed by Xi: “Air dicincang tidak akan putus.”

“True partnerships are not built overnight, but over time — with care, courage and dedication. May the friendship between Malaysia and China endure — deep as the seas, steady as the stars and bright with the promise of tomorrow,” he said.",1.74527E+12,en,0.379947215,2025-04-21 04:29:55,"['spectrum', 'minister', 'broad', 'time', 'laboratory', 'sector', 'across', 'finas', 'deal', 'china', 'road', 'holder', 'exchanged', 'strain', 'including', 'ibrahim', 'respect', 'southeast', 'cooperation', 'commerce', 'pointed', 'precipice', 'addition', 'sea', 'administration', 'beidou', 'overnight', 'jinpings', 'export', 'conflict', 'market', 'trade', 'grounded', 'seri', 'decade', 'agree', 'mutual', 'occasion', 'security', 'step', 'include', 'strong', 'belt', 'satellite', 'intellectual', 'agriculture', 'past', 'facilitate', 'emerging', 'warning', 'upgrade', 'proverb', 'collaboration', 'another', 'enhance', 'firm', 'featured', 'mdec', 'care', 'navigation', 'motac', 'educational', 'lumpur', 'offer', 'renewed', 'investment', 'pause', 'secured', 'food', 'material', 'zerosum', 'think', 'promise', 'shared', 'year', 'infrastructure', 'world', 'harmony', 'note', 'often', 'sense', 'programme', 'retreat', 'transformation', 'essential', 'protocol', 'may', 'hope', 'added', 'current', 'covered', 'asia', 'malaysian', 'three', 'park', 'difference', 'international', 'university', 'bri', 'wider', 'power', 'lab', 'expanded', 'economic', 'cultural', 'also', 'exchange', 'additional', 'bright', 'area', 'official', 'key', 'remained', 'tomorrow', 'islam', 'production', 'threeday', 'science', 'fruit', 'unilateralism', 'lease', 'barrier', 'mardhiah', 'prominently', 'protection', 'group', 'chinese', 'medium', 'dicincang', 'state', 'reaffirmation', 'ministry', 'saw', 'fresh', 'rising', 'place', 'formation', 'institute', 'association', 'datuk', 'meanwhile', 'courage', 'announced', 'focused', 'mous', 'affirmed', 'changed', 'framework', 'technology', 'two', 'partnership', 'precondition', 'tidak', 'described', 'memorandum', 'railway', 'critique', 'endeavour', 'malay', 'tie', 'news', 'speech', 'advanced', 'game', 'rather', 'chinamalaysia', 'xinhua', 'joint', 'agreement', 'visit', 'diplomatic', 'relationship', 'friendship', 'purpose', 'civilisation', 'agreed', 'among', 'citing', 'agency', 'ordinary', 'support', 'development', 'nation', 'exemption', 'tank', 'sustained', 'mti', 'renewal', 'defence', 'anniversary', 'twin', 'engagement', 'global', 'star', 'coincided', 'visa', 'service', 'bernama', 'universiti', 'mot', 'dedication', 'country', 'cooperate', 'action', 'body', 'strengthen', 'peking', 'access', 'corp', 'multilateralism', 'regulatory', 'rivalry', 'deep', 'stressing', 'promote', 'film', 'enriched', 'dialogue', 'art', 'digital', 'understanding', 'affair', 'standardisation', 'interfaith', 'tourism', 'tribalism', 'memoranda', 'involving', 'national', 'jointly', 'five', 'framed', 'intelligence', 'weaponised', 'forming', 'passport', 'culture', 'built', 'study', 'public', 'second', 'system', 'kuala', 'part', 'reflect', 'industrial', 'economy', 'relation', 'televisyen', 'describing', 'confucianism', 'communication', 'air', 'content', 'endure', 'anwar', 'artificial', 'issued', 'took', 'foreign', 'property', 'environment', 'away', 'calling', 'banquet', 'radio', 'rtm', 'echoed', 'initiative', 'reinforcing', 'tour', 'mou', 'establishment', 'april', 'history', 'establish', 'industry', 'cmg', 'malaysia', 'officially', 'president', 'bilateral', 'said', 'marked', 'coconut', 'putus', 'expressed', 'true', 'prime', 'along', 'urged', 'zhejiang', 'new', 'malaya', 'aufa', 'signed', 'steadfast', 'akan', 'implement', 'transport', 'steady', 'promoting', 'speak']",Neutral

Jaecoo Malaysia promised that it will launch the Jaecoo J7 PHEV in February, and it has delivered on the final day of the month. Now, those considering the hot-selling J7 can choose between a pure ICE powertrain or a plug-in hybrid that promises up to 1,300 km of range on a full tank, for a premium.

That’s what you want to know, so here it is – the Jaecoo J7 PHEV is available in a single high-spec variant, priced at RM158,800 on-the-road without insurance. That’s lower than the estimated RM170k figure, and is just RM10k more than the petrol-only J7 AWD, which goes for RM148,800 (the 2WD is another RM10k cheaper). Like the ICE-powered J7, the CKD PHEV rolls out of Chery’s plant in Shah Alam.

What’s different here is under the hood, where the J7’s 1.6-litre turbocharged four-cylinder engine and seven-speed dual-clutch transmission is replaced by a hybrid-specific version of the Omoda 5’s 1.5-litre turbo engine. Here, it makes 141 hp and 215 Nm of torque – paired with a 204 PS/310 Nm electric motor and a single-speed dedicated hybrid transmission (DHT), total output of the Super Hybrid System (SHS) is 347 PS and 525 Nm.

That’s a big jump from the regular J7’s 194 hp/290 Nm, and the front-wheel-drive 1,795 kg PHEV is seven tenths of a second quicker than the ICE from 0-100 km/h at 8.5 seconds. Top speed is 180 km/h. However, the PHEV’s main selling point is fuel economy. Jaecoo claims petrol consumption of 4.77 litres per 100 km (NEDC) when the battery is depleted (at the minimum 20% SoC).

Speaking of the battery, it’s a BYD-sourced 18.3 kWh Blade lithium iron phosphate (LFP) unit that’s capable of 106 km NEDC-rated electric range – good enough for a few days of school/grocery runs. Jaecoo says that the system never allows charge levels to fall below 20%, which ‘guarantees optimal battery health and performance throughout its life cycle’. The IP68-rated ‘puncture-proof’ battery is claimed to last up to one million km.

If you’re going on a road trip, the battery combines with a 60-litre fuel tank for an overall claimed range of up to 1,300 km (NEDC). Sounds big, but that headlining range figure is realistic, conservative even.

Our man Jonathan Lee was part of a fuel efficiency drive last month and the group drove 1,066 km from Singapore to Hat Yai in Thailand. His car averaged 3.8 litres per 100 km almost entirely on highways and still had 190 km of range remaining, as estimated by the SUV’s trip computer. By the way, while Jaecoo Malaysia quotes NEDC range figures, the WLTP numbers are 88 km EV and up to 1,200 km total.

By the way, the J7 PHEV supports up to 40 kW of DC fast charging power, which tops up the battery from 30% to 80% in 20 minutes. The more likely charging scenario is at home, and Jaecoo sells a wallbox separately. At 6.6 kW max AC, a full charge takes less than four hours. Again, the pure EV range is 106 km NEDC.

The rest of the car is as per the J7 except for minor details such as the aero-design 19-inch alloys (we noticed that they’re similar to the Omoda E5’s but with different covers), curvier door mirrors, a chequered flag pattern on the door trim strips and the removal of the ICE variant’s fake tailpipes. There’s a ‘PHEV’ logo on the tailgate.

Inside the black interior, the PHEV gets a simpler, sleeker door card design (no more chunky door grab handles and physical wing mirror switches) and a revised centre console that dispenses with the ICE’s large drive mode selector and gear lever. In place of the latter is a steering column stalk. The freed up space between the seats gets a row of physical buttons for the EV and HEV powertrain modes. The 10.25-inch digital instrument display gets PHEV-related graphics.

Surprisingly, the PHEV has more cargo volume than the ICE at 500 litres, despite having a battery under the boot floor. The catch is there’s no full-size spare tyre here, just a can of tyre foam. Fold the rear seats and you’ll get 1,265 litres of space. There’s a party trick here (literally) in the Cinema Tonneau Cover, where the white underside of the tonneau cover can double up as a screen for your projector. There’s a 3.3 kW V2L function for your accessories.

The kit list is pretty much like the ICE car’s – you get full LED lights at both ends, keyless entry and push start, dual-zone climate control (there’s a single rear vent), powered front seats with memory and ventilation (heating too, it comes in a pack), front passenger seat ‘boss switch’, faux leather upholstery, a panoramic glass roof and a powered tailgate with proximity-based hands-free opening.

Top row J7 AWD, bottom row J7 PHEV

In the screen and tech department, you get the above-mentioned digital meter panel, head-up display and a 14.8-inch portrait infotainment touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and wired Android Auto, with sound coming from eight Sony speakers. There’s also a wireless charger, 360-degree camera system and a built-in dashcam.

Safety wise, it’s the full ADAS pack together with front departure alert, a camera-based driver attention monitor, blind spot monitoring, rear cross traffic alert with auto brake, door opening warning and auto high beam. The airbag count is eight, including a front centre airbag and one for the driver’s knee.

Again, the Jaecoo J7 PHEV is priced at RM158,800 on-the-road with insurance and you can have one in Carbon Crystal Black, Moonlight Silver and Khaki White. The latter is a limited edition colour of sorts, and only 100 units will be available. After that, Jaecoo will replace white with the rather fetching Olive Grey colour you see below.

The factory warranty is for seven years or 150,000 km, and there’s a separate eight-year or 160,000 km warranty for the PHEV battery, motor and controller unit. Jaecoo Malaysia promises a one-to-one exchange when the battery’s state of health falls below 70% during the warranty tenure.

“The SHS with its best-in-class technology and performance is what we believe enhances Malaysia’s vibrant hybrid vehicle landscape and creates room for competitive growth. Essentially, we’re happy to provide greater options to drivers looking to make the transition to hybrid mobility, in support of Malaysia’s energy transition ambitions,” said Jaecoo Malaysia VP Emily Lek.

So, if you’re set on the Jaecoo J7, will it be the simplicity of the ICE model or are you drawn to the fuel-efficiency and long range of the PHEV for just RM10k more? A carrot for the PHEV is the early bird package for bookings from now till March 2, where you’ll get 10 years or one million km of vehicle and battery warranty, plus a free V2L charger. Yes, that’s two days to get the extra perk.

Thailand's economy is facing significant challenges as concerns about growth begin to mount. Recent reports indicate the Thai economy is projected to grow at around 3.5% this year, with policymakers pinning their hopes on three key drivers: exports, tourism, and investment. The projections come amid sluggish growth and shifting global trade dynamics, particularly evident with the latest figures pointing to soaring demands from international markets.

According to the National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC), the government aims for GDP growth between 3% and 3.5%, relying heavily on export expansion of approximately 4%. Monthly export values need to maintain above $26 billion to align with these targets, as confirmed by Donucha Pichayanon, the Secretary-General of the NESDC.

The current economic climate poses specific challenges: the global demand for Thai products appears uncertain, and several markets have raised barriers. Chief among these situations is the performance of fruits, particularly mangoes, which are key to Thailand's agricultural exports. A recent increase in demand for Thai mangoes from South Korea, alongside favorable changes to import regulations there, hints at possible pathways for growth. South Korea has ascended to become the leading market for Thai mangoes, surpassing Malaysia, thanks to significant changes like reducing import duties to zero.

According to reports from Thailand's Ministry of Commerce, the export value for mangoes to South Korea is set to reach about 2.93 billion baht, which marks growth of 132.7% compared to the previous year. The rise can largely be attributed to South Korean government policies enhancing import quotas and waiving different tariffs. Fruit enthusiasts, especially health-conscious consumers post-pandemic, have contributed to the mango consumption boom.

""Mango is one of Thailand's most significant exports, following durian and longan. Our tropical fruits, especially mangoes, have always enjoyed strong international demand. Given the unique flavor and quality, they stand out as premium products, particularly favored by South Koreans,"" explained Punpong Nainapakul, Director of the Department of Trade Policy and Strategy.

The 2024 fiscal year has brought about some positive trends for other fruits, with Japan demonstrating rising demand for fresh mangoes amid health trends, and regional markets such as Malaysia showing steady interest. Conversely, Vietnamese and Laotian markets are struggling to keep pace; nevertheless, they account for smaller portions of Thailand’s overall fruit exports.

The broader picture painted by the NESDC showcases optimistic drives across the tourism sector, which aims to attract around 38 million foreign tourists over the course of the year. The expected revenue influx would ideally strengthen both the economy and domestic consumption levels.

With tourism being touted as another pillar for economic growth, higher-quality clientele is the target, aiming to raise tourist spending beyond the current average of 42,000 baht ($1,200) per head, as stated by government officials. This move is expected to significantly propel revenue from the travel sector.

Simultaneously, Thailand is eager to boost investment both domestically and from foreign partners to stimulate economic activity. Measures are being put forth to improve government procurement processes to expedite disbursement rates, intending to exceed the benchmark of 85%. The overall investment outlook remains cautiously optimistic, yet numerous governmental entities are tasked with fortifying the sectors necessary to meet growth metrics, as outlined initially.

Overall, the expected growth of the Thai economy exhibits resilience, shaped by both internal capabilities and external market conditions. Sectoral improvements – particularly within exports, tourism, and investments – will determine whether Thailand can overcome present uncertainties and sustain its long-term ambitions.",1.74079E+12,en,0.408905089,2025-02-28 05:33:32,"['beyond', 'per', 'following', 'average', 'brought', 'sector', 'across', 'consumption', 'head', 'punpong', 'outlook', 'policy', 'particularly', 'nainapakul', 'tourist', 'import', 'commerce', 'quota', 'secretarygeneral', 'touted', 'export', 'influx', 'stand', 'governmental', 'present', 'around', 'demonstrating', 'yet', 'market', 'trade', 'contributed', 'painted', 'higherquality', 'move', 'unique', 'tasked', 'simultaneously', 'monthly', 'vietnamese', 'cautiously', 'strong', 'social', 'projection', 'specific', 'pose', 'expected', 'driver', 'capability', 'nevertheless', 'uncertainty', 'another', 'fiscal', 'surpassing', 'showcase', 'steady', 'travel', 'clientele', 'investment', 'durian', 'struggling', 'facing', 'domestic', 'disbursement', 'director', 'course', 'year', 'change', 'grow', 'performance', 'boost', 'within', 'relying', 'value', 'appears', 'soaring', 'council', 'thanks', 'hope', 'current', 'healthconscious', 'portion', 'propel', 'forth', 'three', 'pathway', 'come', 'significantly', 'international', 'optimistic', 'increase', 'internal', 'thailand', 'projected', 'evident', 'economic', 'picture', 'attract', 'exhibit', 'uncertain', 'soar', 'pace', 'improvement', 'enhancing', 'korea', 'thai', 'official', 'become', 'key', 'duty', 'improve', 'enjoyed', 'favored', 'different', 'shifting', 'fruit', 'trend', 'regional', 'barrier', 'especially', 'remains', 'policymakers', 'postpandemic', 'pillar', 'spending', 'drive', 'one', 'showing', 'flavor', 'ministry', 'explained', 'latest', 'rise', 'rising', 'donucha', 'fresh', 'target', 'possible', 'significant', 'set', 'entity', 'positive', 'account', 'baht', 'mount', 'ideally', 'expansion', 'revenue', 'external', 'domestically', 'sustain', 'challenge', 'maintain', 'determine', 'attributed', 'mark', 'laotian', 'previous', 'numerous', 'premium', 'eager', 'situation', 'metric', 'product', 'among', 'tariff', 'begin', 'gdp', 'raise', 'benchmark', 'development', 'hint', 'japan', 'raised', 'necessary', 'ambition', 'figure', 'demand', 'procurement', 'stimulate', 'resilience', 'keep', 'million', 'conversely', 'leading', 'longan', 'health', 'global', 'measure', 'overall', 'need', 'alongside', 'waiving', 'pichayanon', 'strengthen', 'amid', 'dynamic', 'indicate', 'confirmed', 'align', 'given', 'activity', 'nesdc', 'south', 'agricultural', 'tourism', 'climate', 'strategy', 'report', 'approximately', 'national', 'sluggish', 'aiming', 'expedite', 'stated', 'growth', 'longterm', 'interest', 'smaller', 'would', 'meet', 'according', 'regulation', 'recent', 'compared', 'korean', 'concern', 'partner', 'aim', 'ascended', 'zero', 'outlined', 'government', 'economy', 'always', 'condition', 'broader', 'rate', 'sectoral', 'intending', 'largely', 'mango', 'foreign', 'favorable', 'grapple', 'put', 'heavily', 'whether', 'chief', 'reach', 'exceed', 'several', 'pinning', 'malaysia', 'boom', 'department', 'level', 'reducing', 'pointing', 'billion', 'enthusiast', 'shift', 'quality', 'process', 'initially', 'overcome', 'tropical', 'consumer', 'shaped', 'fortifying', 'like']",Neutral

The investment is expected to help PMG expand its core healthcare services across Malaysia, particularly in underserved communities, the company said.

The group plans to aggressively expand its network nationwide, prompted by opportunities in a consolidating market, said PMG Healthcare founder and chairman Dr Chieng King Chong.

“This collaboration will empower us to expand our successful integrated healthcare services model nationwide, upgrade our facilities, implement innovative technologies, and make treatments more affordable through effective procurement strategies,” he added.

PMG was established in 2012 in Sarikei, Sarawak, and has since grown into one of the country’s largest integrated primary healthcare providers. Its operations include 152 community pharmacies, 28 medical clinics, and eight dental clinics — a total of 188 outlets nationwide.

Last September, PMG Healthcare acquired Johor-based AM PM Pharmacy, which added 46 outlets to its pharmacy network.

Ikhlas Capital, which has a presence in Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, and Manila, targets growth-stage investments and transformation opportunities within ASEAN.

Founded by TS Nazir Razak and partners – Kenny Kim, Gita Wirjawan, and Cesar Purisima – the firm has more than 100 years of experience shaping ASEAN. Its investors include over 50 ASEAN institutions and family offices.

The firm focuses on growth, transformation, and cross-border value creation.

“PMG Healthcare is not just a financial investment. We see ourselves as allies in PMG’s mission to shape the future of the healthcare industry,” said TS Nazir Razak, Chairman of Ikhlas Group.

Commenting on the investment, Sarawak’s deputy premier and minister for Public Health, Housing and Local Government, Datuk Amar Prof. Dr. Sim Kui Hian, said that public-private partnerships are a key element in developing sustainable healthcare solutions for the state.

He said the collaboration between PMG Healthcare Group and Ikhlas Capital could improve access to primary and preventive care, enhance health education, and bolster public health programmes in line with Sarawak’s long-term goals.",1.74079E+12,en,0.528828561,2025-02-28 03:47:35,"['deputy', 'family', 'minister', 'asean', 'sim', 'dental', 'across', 'pmgs', 'cesar', 'preventive', 'particularly', 'integrated', 'underserved', 'aggressively', 'consolidating', 'chieng', 'founder', 'clinic', 'equity', 'market', 'medical', 'include', 'largest', 'expected', 'announcement', 'upgrade', 'collaboration', 'enhance', 'firm', 'healthcare', 'crossborder', 'plan', 'care', 'lumpur', 'investment', 'last', 'purisima', 'mission', 'kenny', 'nationwide', 'year', 'sarikei', 'within', 'wirjawan', 'programme', 'transformation', 'value', 'network', 'added', 'september', 'grown', 'kim', 'razak', 'element', 'could', 'gita', 'presence', 'manila', 'nazir', 'primary', 'prof', 'opportunity', 'since', 'improve', 'key', 'housing', 'shape', 'prompted', 'ringgit', 'acquired', 'experience', 'king', 'one', 'group', 'malaysiabased', 'state', 'publicprivate', 'creation', 'model', 'target', 'datuk', 'sarawak', 'make', 'chairman', 'technology', 'partnership', 'investor', 'pmg', 'see', 'private', 'future', 'core', 'chong', 'pharmacy', 'financial', 'effective', 'education', 'procurement', 'bolster', 'amar', 'million', 'capital', 'premier', 'health', 'service', 'commenting', 'successful', 'country', 'kui', 'shaping', 'jakarta', 'access', 'focus', 'ally', 'provider', 'growthstage', 'founded', 'strategy', 'company', 'innovative', 'help', 'office', 'growth', 'longterm', 'community', 'affordable', 'expand', 'facility', 'total', 'solution', 'according', 'institution', 'partner', 'public', 'kuala', 'government', 'empower', 'invested', 'operation', 'goal', 'local', 'ikhlas', 'line', 'eight', 'treatment', 'industry', 'malaysia', 'said', 'singaporeheadquartered', 'established', 'developing', 'hian', 'outlet', 'sustainable', 'implement', 'johorbased']",Positive

According to a press release by MDEC, this is thanks to a stable government and pro-business policies in reinforcing the country’s reputation as a regional tech hub.

Moreover, strong infrastructure and strategic public-private partnerships have strengthened investor confidence in Malaysia as a leading digital hub.

MDEC further added that a supportive regulatory framework and Malaysia’s push into AI and quantum computing further accelerated growth, attracting high-value global investments.

These include investments from global giants like Google, Microsoft, and Bytedance.

This report follows the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (MIDA)’s announcement that Malaysia secured RM378.5 billion in approved investments in total last year.

MDEC CEO Anuar Fariz Fadzil / Image Credit: MDEC

This is the highest in Malaysia’s history, marking a 14.9% year-on-year increase from the previous record of RM329.5 billion in 2023.

“As an agency under the Ministry of Digital, MDEC continues to work closely with MIDA and other government agencies to attract more strategic investments,” said MDEC CEO Anuar Fariz Fadzil.

Attracting foreign and domestic investments

It’s clear that foreign investor confidence in Malaysia’s digital sector remains strong.

MDEC reported that the substantial top five countries with the highest foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows are Singapore (RM57 billion), the United States (RM23 billion), China (RM12 billion), Australia (RM2.6 billion), and India (RM2 billion).

At the same time, domestic direct investments (DDI) continue to rise. MDEC has played a pivotal role in this through strategic initiatives and programmes.

The top five states by Malaysia Digital (MD) companies’ inflows were recorded in the Klang Valley (RM136 billion), Johor (RM22 billion), Penang (RM3 billion), Sabah (RM423 million) and Sarawak (RM280 million).

Investments in data centres and cloud infrastructure accounted for 76.8% of total approved digital investments in 2024, a sharp rise from 55.5% in 2023.

The establishment of a dedicated Data Centre Task Force, spearheaded by MITI Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz and Digital Minister Gobind Singh Deo, is set to drive further growth while ensuring it aligns with long-term sustainability goals, balancing expansion with environmental responsibility.

Anuar shared, “MDEC stands steadfast in sustaining this strong investment momentum and working closely with MIDA to achieve the targeted 5% investment growth in 2025.”

Tapping into the money

With Malaysia’s digital investments reaching unprecedented heights, there’s no better time for Malaysian SMEs and startups to ride this wave of growth.

The presence of global tech giants like Google and Microsoft signals opportunities for local businesses to embrace AI, cloud computing, and next-gen digital solutions.

Paired with strong government support and rising domestic investments, the stage is set for homegrown innovators to scale, compete, and lead in the digital economy.

Singapore/ New Delhi [India], February 28: Three cross-border teams emerged as winners at the Singapore International Foundation's (SIF) Climate Hack 2024 Pitch Day recently, marking the finale of the five-month programme which began in September 2024. First launched in 2021, Climate Hack aims to equip individuals in Asia with digital skills to develop and accelerate tech-driven solutions for climate change.







The winning teams were represented by 13 youths from India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, and the Philippines. The winning ideas included strategic cross-sector partnerships to ensure scalability, personalised user experiences to address unique needs, and more cost-effective alternatives to existing solutions.







More than 300 youths from 27 countries participated in the programme to develop climate solutions. They received training from leading industry experts in areas such as digital proficiencies, problem-solving skills, entrepreneurial thinking, and best practices in presenting and marketing their ideas. Nine out of the ten shortlisted teams comprised youths from different countries, reflecting the criticality of collaboration in addressing climate challenges.







Ms. Manvitha Yalamanchili, a member of Sustainloop and a Climate Hack 2024 winner from India said: ""When I first connected with my teammates from Malaysia and the Philippines, we found that we shared the same dream of creating meaningful impact in the climate space despite coming from different countries. That is what brought us together to form Sustainloop. Our team's diverse backgrounds allowed us to gain insights from different industries, and I am thrilled to have found inspiring mentors in my teammates.""







Jaryll Chan, SIF Executive Director, Programmes Division, said: ""Climate change affects every single one of us as we live in an interconnected world. At the SIF, we believe in driving collaborations to develop solutions for a better world.""







Winning Teams Announced at Pitch Day of Climate Hack 2024







At Pitch Day, 10 shortlisted teams presented their tech-driven solutions to a panel of judges. They addressed environmental challenges in areas such as natural resource management, land use, transport, waste management, and ecological economics.









Three winning teams were chosen based on their creativity, persuasiveness, teamwork, and the impact and feasibility of their solution. They are:



1. E-Connect (Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, and the Philippines)



2. SustainIQ (Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, and the Philippines)



3. Sustainloop (India, Malaysia, and the Philippines)



Additionally, Ecovolve (Cambodia, Indonesia, and Singapore), received the People's Choice Award. The award was based on voting on social media leading up to Pitch Day and by the live audience during the event.







All four teams will visit Singapore in March this year to learn more about the Singapore Green Plan 2030 - a whole-of-nation movement to advance Singapore's national agenda on sustainable development.



Carla Gomez Briones, Climate and Sustainability Specialist, United Nations Development Program Global Centre for Technology, Innovation, and Sustainable Development (Singapore) was one of the judges at Pitch Day. She shared: ""The ingenuity and depth of thought demonstrated by the teams have been truly inspiring. From tackling diverse challenges like natural resource management to rethinking waste systems, these young changemakers have shown a remarkable ability to innovate with purpose and impact. Their solutions not only address urgent climate issues but also reflect the power of collaboration across borders to create a sustainable future.""







Sheena Joy Palcis, a member of E-Connect from the Philippines said: ""Climate Hack has helped me gain insights on turning my climate-resilient ideas into action. Through the workshops, I gained skills to develop an impactful and practical solution. The feedback and resources that I received from our mentors and trainers also helped to ensure that our team's solution remains relevant amidst a rapidly evolving global landscape. There is still much to be done in building a more sustainable society, but I am hopeful for a brighter future with all the youth-led innovations that were presented at Pitch Day!""







Climate Hack 2024 was organised in collaboration with key partners Action for Change in Southeast Asia (ActSEA), Kidzstarter, and Temporary Local. It was supported by volunteer trainers and mentors from IT consultancy Cognizant, social impact organisation DataKind Singapore, and volunteering platform TheOneHourProject, as well as individual professionals who volunteered in their own capacity.







Since 2021, Climate Hack has trained close to 1,000 youths from 24 countries across Asia. Collectively, the programme's participants have developed 130 digital prototypes and solutions to address climate-related challenges.

The proposal is still under study by the Malaysian Institute of Road Safety Research (MIROS) and the Malaysian Green Technology and Climate Change Corporation.

The study is evaluating factors such as the mechanism for implementing the charges, the potential reduction in traffic volume, and the expected increase in public transport usage. It is expected to be completed by the end of this year.

Up to 20% traffic reduction expected in KL

Dr Zaliha noted that congestion charges could reduce traffic in Kuala Lumpur by as much as 20%.

The charge must be set at a balanced rate—it should be high enough to discourage motorists from using certain roads but not so high that it becomes a burden on consumers.

“Within the next two to three years, the situation is expected to recover as anticipated. Therefore, the implementation of congestion charges can actually have positive effects, especially from an economic perspective for small businesses,” she explained.

“As for Kuala Lumpur, particularly in the logistics and delivery sector, we can consider several measures.

For instance, time-based exemptions for logistics vehicles could be introduced, allowing them to operate without incurring congestion charges during specific hours. This is something we can look into.”

For ride-hailing vehicles, taxis, private vehicles owned by building occupants, or hotel guests in the Central Business District (CBD), the ministry will also look into exploring the possibility of offering discounts or exemptions from congestion charges as incentives.

As part of the implementation of congestion fess, Zaliha said that the government will ensure continuous engagement sessions with industry representatives, business communities, logistics operators, and other stakeholders.

This will allow us to gather insights and develop a fair, equitable, and effective implementation plan for everyone.

Learning from global models

She also cited international congestion control measures as references for the study, including:

Public transport readiness a key factor

Responding to Datuk Azman Nasrudin (PN-Padang Serai), who inquired about the mechanism and expected traffic reduction, Dr Zaliha highlighted that 1.5 million vehicles enter and exit Kuala Lumpur daily, while public transport ridership is only at 25% capacity.

She agreed with Transport Minister Anthony Loke that congestion charges should not be introduced until the public transport system is fully improved and integrated.

On February 19, Loke stated in the Dewan Rakyat that the plan will only proceed once Malaysia’s public transport infrastructure is ready to support the shift.

The disappointed public, who felt disadvantaged, is considering buying fuel from Pertamina's competitors.

Based on Tempo's investigation, fuel prices in Malaysia are relatively cheaper than in Indonesia. A comparison of fuel prices from February 27 to March 5, 2025, can be found on the official website of Malaysia's oil company, Petroliam Nasional Berhad, or Petronas.

Primax RON 95 is priced at RM2.05/liter or approximately Rp7,500/liter. Primax RON 97 is sold for RM3.43/liter or approximately Rp12,680/liter.

Furthermore, Diesel Euro 5-B10/B20 is sold for RM3.18/liter or around Rp11,750/liter. Meanwhile, Diesel Euro 5-B7 is priced at RM3.38/liter or around Rp12,490/liter.

On the other hand, fuel prices in Indonesia produced by state-owned oil and gas firm PT Pertamina (Persero) in February 2025 are sold for Rp12,900/liter for Pertamax (RON 92).

Pertamax Turbo (RON 98) is sold for Rp14,000/liter; Dexlite is sold for Rp14,600/liter; Pertamina Dex is sold for Rp14,800/liter; and Pertalite is priced at Rp10,000/liter.

According to Tempo Data Science, cheap oil prices in a country are usually influenced by government subsidies, as seen with low prices in Iran and Russia.

The price of 95-octane fuel in Indonesia is recorded at US$0.79 or around Rp13,000 per liter. This means that fuel prices in Indonesia with the same octane rating are more expensive than in Malaysia. In Malaysia, 95-octane fuel is sold for about US$0.46, or Rp7,500 per liter.

First launched in 2021, Climate Hack aims to equip individuals in Asia with digital skills to develop and accelerate tech-driven solutions for climate change.

The winning teams were represented by 13 youths from India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, and the Philippines. The winning ideas included strategic cross-sector partnerships to ensure scalability, personalised user experiences to address unique needs, and more cost-effective alternatives to existing solutions.

More than 300 youths from 27 countries participated in the programme to develop climate solutions. They received training from leading industry experts in areas such as digital proficiencies, problem-solving skills, entrepreneurial thinking, and best practices in presenting and marketing their ideas. Nine out of the ten shortlisted teams comprised youths from different countries, reflecting the criticality of collaboration in addressing climate challenges.

Mr Wan Muhamad Asyrad Wan Zaki, a member of Sustainloop and a Climate Hack 2024 winner from Malaysia said: “We formed a cross-border team – representing India, Malaysia, and the Philippines – to tap into the ASEAN network and expand our business across multiple markets. Working with people from different cultures has taught us to value diverse viewpoints, communicate clearly to avoid misunderstandings, and respect local customs and practices. This approach helped us innovate faster, build stronger partnerships, and tailor our strategies for each market.”

Mr Jaryll Chan, SIF Executive Director, Programmes Division, said: “Climate change affects every single one of us as we live in an interconnected world. At the SIF, we believe in driving collaborations to develop solutions for a better world.”

Winning Teams Announced at Pitch Day of Climate Hack 2024

At Pitch Day, 10 shortlisted teams presented their tech-driven solutions to a panel of judges. They addressed environmental challenges in areas such as natural resource management, land use, transport, waste management, and ecological economics.

Three winning teams were chosen based on their creativity, persuasiveness, teamwork, and the impact and feasibility of their solution. They are:

E-Connect (Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, and the Philippines)

(Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, and the Philippines) SustainIQ (Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, and the Philippines)

(Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, and the Philippines) Sustainloop (India, Malaysia, and the Philippines)

Additionally, Ecovolve (Cambodia, Indonesia, and Singapore), received the People’s Choice Award. The award was based on voting on social media leading up to Pitch Day and by the live audience during the event.

Mr Ahmad Yasri Zaenuri, a member of Ecovolve from Indonesia said: “The Climate Hack programme helped to refine our solution by pushing us to challenge assumptions and ensure the scalability of our app. Under the guidance of our mentor Ms Caitlin Medley from Australia, I learnt to make our digital carbon tracking solution more actionable and better understood the business aspect of climate tech. Another highlight was the opportunity to work alongside other passionate teams in tackling the climate crisis from different angles.”

All four teams will visit Singapore in March this year to learn more about the Singapore Green Plan 2030 – a whole-of-nation movement to advance Singapore’s national agenda on sustainable development.

Ms Carla Gomez Briones, Climate and Sustainability Specialist, United Nations Development Program Global Centre for Technology, Innovation, and Sustainable Development (Singapore) was one of the judges at Pitch Day. She shared: “The ingenuity and depth of thought demonstrated by the teams have been truly inspiring. From tackling diverse challenges like natural resource management to rethinking waste systems, these young changemakers have shown a remarkable ability to innovate with purpose and impact. Their solutions not only address urgent climate issues but also reflect the power of collaboration across borders to create a sustainable future.”

Ms Sheena Joy Palcis, a member of E-Connect from the Philippines said: “Climate Hack has helped me gain insights on turning my climate-resilient ideas into action. Through the workshops, I gained skills to develop an impactful and practical solution. The feedback and resources that I received from our mentors and trainers also helped to ensure that our team’s solution remains relevant amidst a rapidly evolving global landscape. There is still much to be done in building a more sustainable society, but I am hopeful for a brighter future with all the youth-led innovations that were presented at Pitch Day!”

Climate Hack 2024 was organised in collaboration with key partners Action for Change in Southeast Asia (ActSEA), Kidzstarter, and Temporary Local. It was supported by volunteer trainers and mentors from IT consultancy Cognizant, social impact organisation DataKind Singapore, and volunteering platform TheOneHourProject, as well as individual professionals who volunteered in their own capacity.

Since 2021, Climate Hack has trained close to 1,000 youths from 24 countries across Asia. Collectively, the programme’s participants have developed 130 digital prototypes and solutions to address climate-related challenges.",1.74079E+12,en,0.579708278,2025-02-28 04:35:19,"['formed', 'app', 'audience', 'zaki', 'prototype', 'sustainability', 'entrepreneurial', 'india', 'australia', 'market', 'develop', 'unique', 'gomez', 'consultancy', 'sustainiq', 'representing', 'diverse', 'trained', 'caitlin', 'world', 'shared', 'included', 'value', 'urgent', 'muhamad', 'power', 'crisis', 'understood', 'volunteered', 'mentor', 'different', 'briones', 'experience', 'problemsolving', 'impact', 'believe', 'issue', 'highlight', 'jaryll', 'pakistan', 'tech', 'viewpoint', 'landscape', 'development', 'nation', 'shortlisted', 'tracking', 'first', 'professional', 'climateresilient', 'theonehourproject', 'country', 'passionate', 'ensure', 'digital', 'best', 'rethinking', 'executive', 'national', 'expert', 'solution', 'partner', 'aim', 'collectively', 'evolving', 'day', 'strategic', 'actsea', 'much', 'shown', 'industry', 'wan', 'land', 'malaysia', 'cambodia', 'winner', 'turning', 'philippine', 'amidst', 'across', 'comprised', 'equip', 'organisation', 'southeast', 'asyrad', 'program', 'nine', 'existing', 'single', 'changemakers', 'learnt', 'social', 'specialist', 'collaboration', 'another', 'crossborder', 'waste', 'winning', 'depth', 'programme', 'pushing', 'network', 'angle', 'september', 'idea', 'began', 'three', 'event', 'participant', 'international', 'opportunity', 'individual', 'based', 'learn', 'key', 'joy', 'temporary', 'business', 'relevant', 'border', 'criticality', 'hack', 'zaenuri', 'economics', 'voting', 'announced', 'make', 'challenge', 'society', 'partnership', 'platform', 'volunteering', 'finale', 'econnect', 'purpose', 'ahmad', 'techdriven', 'carla', 'presented', 'demonstrated', 'global', 'building', 'assumption', 'personalised', 'ability', 'gain', 'young', 'innovate', 'approach', 'climaterelated', 'system', 'guidance', 'practice', 'singapore', 'skill', 'local', 'marking', 'thinking', 'brighter', 'indonesia', 'still', 'training', 'creativity', 'resource', 'four', 'volunteer', 'asean', 'yasri', 'carbon', 'choice', 'developed', 'respect', 'driving', 'build', 'refine', 'impactful', 'ecological', 'participated', 'taught', 'use', 'proficiency', 'actionable', 'palcis', 'ten', 'avoid', 'feasibility', 'team', 'change', 'member', 'feedback', 'address', 'tackling', 'truly', 'affect', 'scalability', 'tailor', 'thought', 'medley', 'working', 'marketing', 'one', 'launched', 'award', 'ecovolve', 'technology', 'centre', 'chosen', 'green', 'remarkable', 'crosssector', 'future', 'alternative', 'hopeful', 'need', 'done', 'create', 'action', 'sheena', 'custom', 'every', 'multiple', 'people', 'additionally', 'communicate', 'climate', 'strategy', 'persuasiveness', 'culture', 'inspiring', 'teamwork', 'pitch', 'represented', 'cognizant', 'user', 'interconnected', 'kidzstarter', 'division', 'sponsor', 'march', 'sif', 'better', 'transport', 'supported', 'work', 'insight', 'wholeofnation', 'workshop', 'judge', 'foundation', 'clearly', 'plan', 'fivemonth', 'director', 'chan', 'stronger', 'year', 'ingenuity', 'live', 'tap', 'asia', 'manila', 'aspect', 'also', 'since', 'rapidly', 'area', 'management', 'advance', 'misunderstanding', 'trainer', 'remains', 'agenda', 'united', 'medium', 'panel', 'well', 'youth', 'natural', 'helped', 'addressing', 'visit', 'organised', 'addressed', 'accelerate', 'environmental', 'leading', 'close', 'alongside', 'datakind', 'costeffective', 'sustainloop', 'youthled', 'innovation', 'capacity', 'practical', 'movement', 'expand', 'faster', 'received', 'reflect', 'february', 'presenting', 'said', 'gained', 'sustainable', 'emerged', 'reflecting', 'like']",Positive

This groundbreaking product seamlessly combines the long-lasting freshness of toothpaste with the deep-cleaning power of mouthwash, delivering an unparalleled oral hygiene experience.

To announce the arrival of this highly anticipated, game-changing product, the team at FCB SHOUT – Darlie Malaysia’s long-standing creative agency – has crafted a high-impact campaign spanning multiple channels, including a film that is currently airing on TV and across digital platforms, an attention-grabbing teaser in the guise of a Fake Out-of-Home content, an immersive anamorphic 3D billboard at Pavilion KL, a nationwide Digital Out-of-Home rollout, and a robust influencer marketing push. The campaign was designed to heighten excitement and intrigue among the consumers, reinforcing the idea that a revolutionary oral care innovation is finally here.

Ian Chew, General Manager, Hawley & Hazel – Malaysia & Indonesia, expressed his enthusiasm for this latest breakthrough, “At Darlie, we are committed to pushing the boundaries of oral care innovation to bring people closer with a smile. Our new 2-IN-1 Mouthwash + Toothpaste is designed to deliver a deeper clean & superior fresh breath experience with every brush, making it easier for Malaysians to feel confident throughout the day. We are thrilled to introduce this first-of-its-kind product to the market and can’t wait for everyone to experience the difference. This will be our new flagship product, and we have strategically launched it nearing Ramadan because fresh breath is especially crucial for many Malaysians during this period, and we believe there’s no better time to prove the efficacy of this product than now.”

Tjer, the Executive Creative Director of FCB SHOUT, was equally as excited for the launch of the campaign, “The launch of Malaysia’s first 2-IN-1 Mouthwash Toothpaste gave us the opportunity to create something truly unique in the way we introduced it. Our team rose to the challenge by going beyond traditional approaches and finding unconventional, high-impact ways to engage the audience, from the eye-catching FOOH teaser to the stunning anamorphic 3D billboard in the heart of Kuala Lumpur – it was truly every creative’s dream to be able to work on a campaign of this scale. It’s been an incredibly rewarding experience, and we’re grateful to our production partners like Restless Productions, Amazed, Real Time Studios and Rawr Pictures, as well as Darlie’s media partners Search Guru, iCanvas and Spark, for helping us bring this vision to life.”

Shaun Tay, Co-Owner and Chief Executive Officer of The SHOUT Group, emphasised the significance of this launch, “It’s always exciting when a brand like Darlie pushes the envelope in product development and brings something truly game-changing to the market. This project isn’t just about launching a new product – it’s about setting new benchmarks for creativity and engagement. And the best part? This campaign is being adapted across different Darlie markets across Asia as we speak, amplifying its impact even further. Exciting times indeed for both Darlie and FCB SHOUT!”

The campaign was launched on 21 February 2025 and is running across all Darlie social media channels and on broadcast TV, out-of-home media and digital media. More materials will be released throughout the year as part of this year-long campaign.

outbreak,Henry Butcher: Industrial and residential subsectors to perform well in 2025,1.74073E+12,The Edge Malaysia,https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/744478,https://news.google.com/read/CBMiUEFVX3lxTFB3cHpGQVlHMGtCSmFvalAtS0o3aGhpWFVjRFA1NmtMWjkxaFE3ZF9NRzRWemlnTDJTWXJSVDdZMUo3N0JEVGhHbXNmS1ZLZkQ0?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/744478,"This article first appeared in City & Country, The Edge Malaysia Weekly on February 17, 2025 - February 23, 2025

The property market’s industrial and residential subsectors will be the top two performers for 2025 barring any unforeseen circumstances, according to Henry Butcher Malaysia during the launch of its HB Perspective: Malaysia Property Outlook 2025 report on Jan 22.

The consultancy’s chief operating officer Tang Chee Meng said: “We believe that the industrial subsector will continue to lead in terms of market performance, unless US President Donald Trump comes in with a lot of restrictions that will jeopardise all the supply chains, and the Malaysian government’s ambition of making the country a regional centre of chip design and manufacturing fails.

“Otherwise, we believe the industrial subsector will continue to lead the way in terms of performance … especially when you look at the past year, when big multinationals like Google and Microsoft announced plans to set up base here.

“The residential subsector has always been the mainstay of the property market. It usually contributes 65% of total transactions in terms of numbers. We believe it will most probably be the second subsector to do well.”

According to Tang, details mentioned in the report are for the first nine months of 2024 (9M2024) as the data from the National Property Information Centre for the final quarter has not been published yet.

“However, our projections and opinions on the outlook don’t depend on these statistics as we consider several factors, such as the economy, investments, political climate, government infrastructure projects and what is happening overseas, before coming to a conclusion,” Tang prefaced before sharing the highlights of the report.

Residential uptick expected

Tang highlighted several factors for the positive outlook on the residential subsector. These include Bank Negara Malaysia’s overnight policy rate remaining at 3%, landbanking activities by property developers, the increase in the minimum wage rate to RM1,700 per month, the tabling of the Urban Renewal Act, the flat 4% stamp duty for foreigners and companies, the digitalisation of the property industry and the numerous infrastructure projects, as well as foreign direct investment (FDI) coming into the country, and the stable government.

“Based on all these factors and not only the statistics, we are confident that the residential property market will be stable and will continue to enjoy steady growth in 2025,” he said.

“There is a possibility that house prices may increase as developers try to recoup the extra costs incurred due to higher building material costs, construction costs and so on as there is a limit to how much the developers can absorb.

“Rehda (Real Estate and Housing Developers’ Association) Malaysia has announced that its members are thinking of increasing prices this year. Of course, the extent of the increase depends on the state of the market. If the market is good, they can raise the price higher, but if the market is so-so, they may have to avoid increasing prices at too fast a pace.

“Overall, we feel the focus for 2025 will still be on landed residential properties because this is the main preference for most Malaysians.”

Affordably-priced high-rise apartments in major towns and cities, especially in the more popular or high-growth locations, will also see demand. Buyers will give eco-friendly homes that have green building standards a look-over and innovative projects in terms of concepts, design and themes will stand out from the pack, he highlighted.

Incidentally, there is a shortage of high-end products as launches have been limited, Tang said. While this might be seen as a gap in the market, developers need to consider various factors.

“Any developer launching this kind of project should be very careful. It has to be in a location that people want to invest in and the design and the pricing must also be right,” he cautioned.

Zeroing in on several states, Tang pointed to Johor with the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (JS-SEZ) as a game changer for the southern state by boosting residential, commercial and industrial subsectors. It could possibly rival the Klang Valley in 10 years, Tang said.

Residential units on Penang Island, along with other types of property, will receive a boost with the implementation of the Mutiara LRT line, which will link George Town city centre to Bayan Lepas and extend to Seberang Perai on the mainland.

In Selangor, state policies such as Integrated Development Region in South Selangor (IDRISS), Smart Selangor Action Plan (SSAP), Selangor Agenda for Green Economy (SAGE) and Rancangan Selangor Pertama (RS-1) will help drive the economy and thus benefit the property market.

Looking ahead, the industrial subsector will see plenty of positives with the focus on data centres. Furthermore, increased FDIs and direct domestic investments from the previous year will continue to boost this subsector’s growth, Tang stated.

“The hottest topic in the industrial property subsector is data centres. We are seeing more and more of such centres being built mainly in Johor and in Selangor. The government has announced they will be focusing a lot on data centres and also chip design and manufacturing,” he said.

He also pointed to the infrastructure projects in Johor and Penang that will boost the subsector, giving investors a reason to set up factories there.

Tang added that the government’s New Industrial Master Plan 2030 and the National Energy Transition Roadmap will bolster the manufacturing subsector, and policies and programmes such as Industry4WRD, IDRISS and JS-SEZ will have a positive impact on the industrial sector.

However, the new Trump administration could put a spanner in the works, although it is too early to say if that will be the case.

“The Trump 2.0 administration is expected to adopt a protectionist policy and various tariffs will be imposed on imports into the US. This will likely affect countries deemed to be not supportive of the US’ efforts to support the US dollar as well as the domestic economy, and this will include China as well as BRIC members, of which Malaysia has recently been admitted as a partner country.

“However, Malaysia may be able to benefit from some rerouting of Chinese manufacturing activities to the country to enjoy lower tariff rates than direct Chinese exports to the US,” he said.

KLCC offices perform well

Tang highlighted that the KL city centre purpose-built office (PBO) occupancy rate in the 9M2024 period outperformed those outside the city centre.

“The occupancy rate of PBOs in the city centre was 72%, which is better than the 63.2% recorded by PBOs outside the city centre. But this trend may change a bit because some companies may feel that in terms of rental, it is better to shift to where the rental is cheaper and not having to come into the city, which is congested,” he said.

With the introduction of mega office tower projects over the past few years, such as The Exchange 106 and Merdeka 118, it has raised concerns of oversupply, although that is yet a certainty, said Tang.

Moreover, with the incoming office supply, the performance of older office buildings will be affected.

“With all this office space coming onstream, older buildings that have not undergone any upgrading or renovation will lose out in terms of retaining tenants and attracting new ones because these new buildings have better facilities with higher specifications. Rent-wise, as the market isn’t that fantastic, the differential isn’t that much. So, you have a situation where tenants are shifting to quality buildings at slightly higher rentals. Owners of all these older buildings, unless they are renovated or repurposed into something else — for example, hotels or serviced apartments — will find they are losing out in the longer term,” he said.

Tang added that if Malaysia’s economic growth goes according to plan and more multinational corporations come in with environmental, social and governance (ESG) specifications for their buildings, it will impact demand for office space and further reduce interest in older buildings.

The country’s total supply of PBOs stood at 18.82 million sq m as at 3Q2024, up slightly from 18.39 million sq m from the same period last year, while the occupancy rate dropped to 71.6% from 72.7% for the same period.

“For KL, PBO space has gone up to 9.657 million sq m as at 3Q2024, of which about 7.554 million sq m or 78% of total supply is located in the city centre. For Selangor, the supply of PBOs is 4.352 million sq m and the occupancy rate has gone up to 71.6% from 70.2% a year ago.

“For Penang, the supply of PBOs is 811,060 sq m. Occupancy rate is better than the national average, at 77.8%. Now 71% of these office spaces are located within George Town and these office spaces have enjoyed higher occupancy rates of above 80% compared to the rest of the state,” he said.

Retail and hospitality on an even keel

The retail subsector is forecast to have a 4% growth rate in 2025. The biggest challenge to this subsector is the rising cost of living, which will influence consumer spending on non-essential items and dining out. Moreover, sales tax was increased to 8% from 6% from March last year, leading to a hike in prices for retail goods and services. This will affect retail spending, Tang highlighted. There is a silver lining, though.

“The Malaysian government increased the remuneration of civil servants from Dec 1, 2024 and these increments should stimulate retail sales during the year-end holidays. The government has also increased the minimum wage from RM1,500 to RM1,700 effective Feb 1, 2025. This will put more disposable income in the hands of consumers and could benefit the retail sector,” he said.

Meanwhile, as at 3Q2024, the Klang Valley — covering Kuala Lumpur, Selangor and Putrajaya — had 290 shopping centres with a total supply of more than 88 million sq ft. The average occupancy rate in KL improved to 78%, Selangor remained unchanged at 73.8% and Putrajaya increased to 76.1%.

Tang said that the weak Malaysian ringgit may encourage international tourists to spend more during their visits, while the high cost of airfares will spur Malaysians to spend their holidays in the country. These will also benefit the hospitality industry.

Last year, the average occupancy rate of hotels in Malaysia in the first six months of 2024 was recorded at 52.6% compared with 50.5% the year before. All states recorded an increase in average occupancy rates, with the highest occupancy rate recorded by Pahang (74.6%), followed by KL (60.3%) and Penang (53.5%).

Tang believes that the hospitality industry will perform well due to several factors. First, the 30-day visa-free initiative for China and India nationals under the Malaysia Visa Liberalisation Plan has been extended to Dec 31, 2026. Also, Asean citizens are currently allowed to stay for more than a month without a visa, according to Tang.

Next year has been designated Visit Malaysia Year and the government is aiming for 26.1 million tourist arrivals with an estimated domestic spending of RM97.6 billion.

Furthermore, financial allocation has also been made for tourism activities.

“In Budget 2025, RM550 million has been earmarked for the Asean Tourism Forum 2025 and Visit Malaysia Year 2026. An additional RM110 million has been allocated for ecotourism.

“The government will also be promoting medical tourism as part of its plans to boost tourist arrivals in the country,” Tang said.

However, one key challenge remains with labour shortage. “The shortage, which has plagued the country, is a major issue faced by the hospitality industry. If the government does not resolve this, it will continue to hamper the recovery and growth of the hospitality industry,” Tang highlighted.

He added that hotels are not in favour of an announcement on earlier check-in times and the labour crunch will make things worse as hotel operators will not have time to ready the rooms for guests.

Despite this, Tang believes that the hospitality industry will fare well in 2025.

Shares of ARB IOT Group Ltd. (ARBB) more than doubled in after-market trade on Thursday after the company signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to set up a new artificial intelligence (AI) data center laboratory.

ARB signed the MoU with a Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) startup that entails setting up an AI data center lab in the region. The company said this lab will be a state-of-the-art facility designed for AI research and development.

It also noted that the AI lab will use the company’s ARB 222 and ARB 333 series of servers to aid in the research, testing, development, and deployment of AI technologies. It will be at the Institute of Visual Informatics at UKM, Malaysia.

ARB noted that these AI servers are optimized for AI inference and data processing, allow for fine-tuning AI training, and handle large-scale simulations.

“Such [an] industry R&D platform will accelerate the translation and commercialization of research, and we anticipate that the lab will actively contribute to the ongoing AI-driven growth and innovation,” said Dato’ Sri Liew Kok Leong, CEO of ARB IOT.

The company said its servers are low-cost alternatives to Nvidia’s H100 and H200 series.

Reacting to the news, retail chatter on Stocktwits exploded, surging by nearly 4,900% over the past 24 hours.

One user called it the “next 1000% plus” stock.

Another user thinks the stock will see a “big bounce” once the news circulates more widely.

ARB’s stock has gained nearly 55% in the last six months, but it is in the red over the past year, with a decline of nearly 69%.

Coordinating Minister for Human Development and Culture Pratikno, after the meeting which lasted about 1 hour from 09.30 WIB, said that the two countries discussed various strategic issues concerning bilateral RI-Malaysia cooperation in various sectors.

""There is a discussion on strengthening economic cooperation, especially the cooperation of the Batam-Johor area,"" he said.

Apart from the economy, the issue of the halal industry is also in the spotlight. Given that Indonesia and Malaysia are the two countries with the largest Muslim population in Southeast Asia, both parties agreed to strengthen collaboration in the development of a sustainable halal industry.

The protection of Indonesian migrant workers is also an important agenda. In this case, the two countries are committed to intensify the implementation of a one channel system to ensure more systematic and secure protection and distribution of Indonesian workers.

Another strategic issue is cooperation in the palm oil sector, where Indonesia and Malaysia are the largest producers in the world.

Pratikno said the two countries plan to strengthen collaboration to face global challenges related to the industry.

In the field of education, said Pratikno, the two leaders agreed to expand cooperation through the Education and Technical and Vocational Educational Education and Training (TVET) program.

Malaysia even plans to send its students to study at various universities and technology institutes in Indonesia.

Tourism cooperation is also a discussion, especially ahead of the 2026 Malaysian Tourism Year.

According to Pratikno, the Malaysian government conveyed its intention to promote tourism in Indonesia as part of the agenda.

Not only that, but the two countries also discussed maritime cooperation, especially the protection of fishermen in border waters, as well as increasing agricultural cooperation.

""Cooperation in agriculture, because the Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia also emphasized that Indonesia's agricultural production is good, so he also wants to learn from Indonesia,"" he said.

In the religious sector, said Pratikno, residential cooperation initiatives were also conveyed for Hajj and Umrah pilgrims in Saudi Arabia as well as strengthening moderate Islamic education between Indonesia and Malaysia.

flood,Kelantan Sultan expresses deep concern over security issues at Malaysia-Thailand border,1.74522E+12,The Edge Malaysia,theedgemalaysia.com,https://news.google.com/read/CBMiUEFVX3lxTE1aQk9KS3VwSXdJeE9qV3ZrTjk3eUYzS3Y5LTA1Vzd6QzlWdEdvMFAteU90RldtNl9VWW1SQzVDQllQMXAtalEyVWdUbnpKU3lV?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/752298,"KOTA BHARU (April 21): The Sultan of Kelantan, Sultan Muhammad V, has expressed deep concern regarding security issues along the Malaysia-Thailand border.

In light of this, he emphasised the urgent need to finalise the proposal for constructing a wall and establishing a buffer zone in the Sungai Golok area without delay.

Sultan Muhammad V said this in his royal address when opening the Third Term of the 15th Kelantan State Legislative Assembly on Monday.

He also stressed the urgent need for a swift resolution to the recurring flood issues in the state.

“I urge that the integrated river basin projects for Sungai Kelantan and Sungai Golok be expedited in all its phases,"" he said.

""Priority must be given to the construction of the Lebir Dam, as it is crucial in addressing the flood challenges in Kelantan,"" he added.

Sultan Muhammad V also urged government agencies, departments, and companies involved in the agricultural sector to remain focused on their core responsibilities while intensifying efforts to ensure the state and country’s food security is firmly secured.

“I strongly encourage the government and the public to explore and cultivate high-potential crops, such as coconut and durian, as valuable sources of income within the agricultural sector.

In line with the Kelantan Agricultural Development Enactment (2022), the Sultan urged the immediate development of an agricultural produce collection centre in Lojing to avoid losing key opportunities for revenue, investment, and economic growth.

Sultan Muhammad V also urged local authorities to focus on ensuring that towns in Kelantan remain clean, beautiful and vibrant, apart from effective municipal management.

“I would like to express my sincere appreciation to the National Landscape Department for its valuable cooperation with the Kota Bharu Municipal Council — Islamic City in successfully executing the landscape project in the Kota Bharu town.

“Additionally, I hope that all local authorities, with the full support of the government, will address the issue of abandoned buildings and capitalise on the economic opportunities within the city to further bolster local development,"" he added.

In addition, the Sultan emphasised the need to accelerate infrastructure development while offering competitive tax exemption incentives to attract greater investment to Kelantan.

“For instance, the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) project is poised to bring new strategic value to the state, particularly through the establishment of a cargo-oriented development zone in Pasir Puteh and a transit-oriented development hub in the emerging township of Tunjong,” he said.

“In addition to enhancing and strengthening the state’s transportation network, this project will also generate significant economic multiplier effects for my people. Therefore, it is vital that the public views this as an opportunity to actively participate and benefit from the spillover impact of such a major development.""

He further recommended that the state government explore and introduce alternative education platforms — particularly in the field of technical and vocational education and training (TVET) — to better align with current industry demands.

“Key focus areas should include the development of the manufacturing sector to attract investments to Kelantan, the upgrading of clean water supply infrastructure and road networks, and the advancement of the agricultural and tourism sectors, along with the empowerment of other high-potential industries.""

Touching on federal-state cooperation, Sultan Muhammad V expressed satisfaction with the harmonious relationship between the two, noting its importance in driving progress.

“Priority should be given to infrastructure projects approved under the 11th and 12th Malaysia Plans, collaborative efforts to optimise land use for agricultural productivity, and the implementation of biodiversity conservation initiatives across the state,” he added.",1.74527E+12,en,0.462478042,2025-04-21 06:19:29,"['full', 'flood', 'clean', 'golok', 'sector', 'supply', 'bharu', 'across', 'road', 'express', 'monday', 'assembly', 'particularly', 'integrated', 'involved', 'driving', 'cooperation', 'addition', 'pasir', 'light', 'ensuring', 'approved', 'conservation', 'puteh', 'successfully', 'crucial', 'abandoned', 'security', 'enactment', 'include', 'firmly', 'explore', 'optimise', 'use', 'emerging', 'town', 'plan', 'muhammad', 'highpotential', 'secured', 'sungai', 'durian', 'investment', 'vital', 'food', 'avoid', 'source', 'priority', 'bring', 'infrastructure', 'establishing', 'within', 'term', 'must', 'value', 'network', 'urgent', 'added', 'municipal', 'council', 'swift', 'hope', 'current', 'strengthening', 'responsibility', 'proposal', 'construction', 'finalise', 'constructing', 'river', 'kota', 'transitoriented', 'progress', 'opportunity', 'attract', 'economic', 'lebir', 'also', 'strongly', 'recurring', 'cultivate', 'tvet', 'area', 'cargooriented', 'enhancing', 'islamic', 'touching', 'key', 'management', 'address', 'immediate', 'emphasised', 'greater', 'regarding', 'royal', 'township', 'resolution', 'dam', 'transportation', 'participate', 'major', 'upgrading', 'benefit', 'state', 'border', 'capitalise', 'significant', 'impact', 'focused', 'appreciation', 'view', 'issue', 'revenue', 'productivity', 'expedited', 'two', 'legislative', 'challenge', 'sultan', 'incentive', 'platform', 'hub', 'without', 'third', 'centre', 'produce', 'competitive', 'poised', 'deep', 'addressing', 'relationship', 'core', 'income', 'landscape', 'kelantan', 'agency', 'city', 'urge', 'accelerate', 'ecrl', 'vocational', 'support', 'effective', 'development', 'water', 'effort', 'exemption', 'education', 'actively', 'bolster', 'alternative', 'demand', 'authority', 'building', 'tax', 'manufacturing', 'malaysiathailand', 'wall', 'need', 'empowerment', 'multiplier', 'biodiversity', 'country', 'apart', 'coast', 'valuable', 'crop', 'technical', 'given', 'introduce', 'instance', 'ensure', 'align', 'focus', 'satisfaction', 'effect', 'losing', 'people', 'agricultural', 'additionally', 'tourism', 'phase', 'company', 'national', 'field', 'implementation', 'growth', 'would', 'remain', 'collaborative', 'noting', 'east', 'concern', 'spillover', 'encourage', 'public', 'harmonious', 'government', 'buffer', 'link', 'offering', 'beautiful', 'strategic', 'importance', 'delay', 'local', 'collection', 'initiative', 'line', 'advancement', 'vibrant', 'establishment', 'april', 'therefore', 'industry', 'generate', 'department', 'malaysia', 'land', 'said', 'coconut', 'project', 'opening', 'intensifying', 'training', 'expressed', 'basin', 'tunjong', 'rail', 'along', 'urged', 'new', 'sincere', 'executing', 'lojing', 'recommended', 'stressed', 'better', 'zone', 'like', 'federalstate']",Neutral

The news about Indriati's not yet buried has gone viral on social media because the person concerned has no relatives.

Based on news of a faction (brafax) from the Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia (KBRI) Kuala Lumpur, Indriati is known to have died in a hospital in the Land of Nine, Malaysia, on January 30, 2025. Since then, no family has taken care of his body.

Based on passport data and population administration information system (SIAK), Indriati's address in Nanga Tayau Village, Amen District, Lebong Regency, Bengkulu.

Meanwhile, her husband's address is in Brasau Village, Tungkal Ulu District, West Tanjung Jabung Regency, Jambi.

The Ministry of Protection of Indonesian Migrant Workers (KemenP2MI) then coordinated with the West Tanjung Jabung Regency Manpower Office and P4MI Jambi to trace the Indriati family regarding the certainty of funerals.

Luckily, the search was successful and a team from the Ministry of P2MI-West Jabung Manpower Office and P4MI Jambi managed to find the Indriati family.

""The family sincerely accepts this sad news and wants the deceased to be buried in Malaysia because it is not possible to be buried in Tanjung Jabung Barat, Jambi,"" the report read.

""The family also expressed their gratitude to the Ministry of P2MI, BP3MI Riau and South Sumatra, as well as elements of the relevant government who have found victims even in sad news, because they have lost contact two years ago,"" the report said.

climate_change,Wild cocoa markets push Europe’s historic chocolatiers to the brink,1.74073E+12,The Edge Malaysia,https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/746304,https://news.google.com/read/CBMiUEFVX3lxTFAzS1J1bXljanJnREFNWDF0U21QRWV5Z1Z4WlItVXA2Yjh6OGRlcDFBVGRjeEhEcGJJMktBWXY5SWZkcGZ1bkxBcnRKeHJMOWhM?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/746304,"LONDON (Feb 28): Paris’s oldest chocolate shop has occupied a street corner in the ninth arrondissement since 1761. Ownership of À la Mère de Famille has changed hands from family to family over the centuries, but it has endured through occupation and revolution thanks to the Parisian appetite for confectionery.

The store’s current owners, the Dolfi family, took it over in 2000 and now sell more than 150 varieties, from nougat to pralines to marzipan, from 16 outlets across the French capital. “This is 100% a family business,” said Steve Dolfi, one of the four siblings who run the chocolatier. “We produce 100% of everything we’re selling.”

But the Dolfis have watched as many of their peers have gone out of business. Government records show that at least a dozen family-owned chocolatiers have closed down across Europe over the past year — casualties of a fourth straight season of tight cocoa supplies, which have driven up prices and squeezed margins across the industry. Larger companies, such as Nestle SA, Lindt & Spruengli AG and Hershey Co, have all taken hits to their share prices, but their scale has enabled them to ride out the disruptions to the market. Smaller artisanal companies have been faced with difficult calculations around what they can charge their customers.

“It’s a tricky game,” Steve’s brother Jonathan said. “But if we don’t increase our prices the company will lose money, we will have to lay people off and we’re going to be in trouble. But if the increase is too much, it’s a risk. We are walking on eggshells.”

Europe is responsible for about half of global cocoa bean imports, which help fuel its US$50 billion (RM222.99 billion) chocolate market. Switzerland and Germany consume more than 20 pounds (9.1kg) of chocolate per person per year. Most of that is imported from West Africa, where harsh weather and virulent crop diseases have hit harvests hard.

In the 2023-24 season, the market experienced a supply deficit of 478,000 metric tons, the largest shortfall since at least the 1980s, according to estimates from the International Cocoa Association. That spurred cocoa prices to nearly triple last year, surging to just shy of US$13,000 a ton, putting enormous pressure on some of the biggest chocolate and food makers. Swiss giant Nestle has passed some of the higher costs on to consumers, but has also had to take mitigating measures, such as adding a higher proportion of biscuits or wafers to some products to lower the amount of cocoa needed.

“The impact of rising costs is being felt across the industry,” Muriel Korter, director general of the Association of Chocolate, Biscuit and Confectionery Industries of Europe said. “However, smaller businesses, which often have fewer resources to absorb these price increases, have had to adapt quickly.”

Some have simply folded. German confectioner Leysieffer produced one of the country’s most popular chocolate pralines for more than a century. The company liquidated in November having previously filed for insolvency in 2022, citing sharp hikes in raw material and energy costs. Weeks earlier, Salzburg Schokolade in Austria, who have been in operation since the late 19th century, closed up its factory that once produced 57 million of its iconic Mozart-inspired chocolates annually.

Rising prices have forced smaller confectioners to make the same challenging decision as the Dolfis, who have raised their prices by 8%.

Austrian chocolatier Franz Hauswirth declared bankruptcy in November of last year after the surge in prices forced the maker of popular Easter bunnies to raise prices. That resulted in “demand destruction”, according to Roman Hauswirth, managing director at the company and a third-generation chocolatier.

This is a pressing concern for smaller companies, as higher prices may force consumers to switch from more expensive independent retailers to bigger mass-market ones. Hershey and Mondelez International Inc., two of the biggest bulk chocolate producers, said last week at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference that consumers will need to adjust to a new normal where chocolate is 40%-50% more costly than it used to be.

“Consumers will shift from buying more expensive to cheaper chocolates,” Steve Wateridge, head of research at market analysis firm Tropical Research Services, said. “Some people are closing down because they can’t afford it and the market is competitive. It’s really on a knife edge at the moment.”

Data on cocoa grinds — where cocoa is turned into butter and powder to use in confectioneries — revealed that bean processing in Europe was the lowest since 2020 during the fourth quarter of last year, suggesting that global consumption might be dropping in response to record-high prices.

Larger companies are trying to reduce their costs by finding alternative ingredients, such as replacing cocoa butter with shea butter-based equivalents or substituting in sunflower or palm oil to cut costs. But artisan producers are reluctant to change their recipes.

Some are trying to find alternative sources, diversifying away from Ivory Coast and Ghana, where the supply shortages are most acute, and toward areas in Central and South America which are seeing their share of global cocoa production steadily increasing.

In Bruges, Belgium, a country famed for its chocolate, Chocolatier Dumon has operated since the 1990s, serving traditional pralines to tourists visiting the medieval city centre. The company produces roughly 500kg of chocolates per week.

“Like most of our colleagues in the past few years, we have been refocusing more toward South America. Mexico and Colombia have become very important for us,” Jelle Descamps, Dumon’s owner, explained. “The crops in Africa have felt the effects of climate change more.”

A busy Christmas period reassured Descamps that, at least for now, demand for Dumon’s chocolate hasn’t fallen significantly. “We are covered for the moment but of course, if cocoa continues at this level, we will have to cover ourselves again at even higher prices,” Descamps said. “That’s a scary thought.”

For chocolatiers looking to the market for a signal of what’s to come, analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co foresee a smaller than anticipated supply shortfall for the current season, trimming their deficit estimates from 108,000 to 40,000 tons, largely due to high prices denting demand.

The likelihood of longer-term respite in prices however will rely on a degree of demand destruction, coupled with improved crop conditions in West Africa, Wateridge said. “When we look forward to 2025-26, as long as we haven’t underestimated the decline in production in Ivory Coast and Ghana and if demand falls further, we will generate a decent sized surplus.”

Even if supplies ease in the longer term, small chocolate producers have a tough year ahead of them. In Paris, the Dolfi family worry about what is lost when longstanding family businesses vanish. “What’s sad in these cases is that recipes and skills are disappearing,” the Dolfi brothers said in an email. “There are a lot of traditions that are passed on by word of mouth.”

With prices still high, the Dolfi family worries about next Christmas, traditionally the most important time of the year for confectioners in Europe. By then, they forecast that chocolate consumers could be grappling with the highest prices in history. The family’s approach to survival between now and then, the brothers said, is like that of many of their peers: “Wait and pray.”",1.74079E+12,en,-0.328650862,2025-02-28 09:03:59,"['annually', 'consumption', 'cocoa', 'mitigating', 'larger', 'period', 'amount', 'replacing', 'central', 'import', 'ease', 'oldest', 'famille', 'operated', 'watched', 'condition', 'market', 'harvest', 'sad', 'finding', 'triple', 'going', 'consume', 'muriel', 'worry', 'material', 'run', 'casualty', 'taken', 'familyowned', 'oil', 'analyst', 'term', 'longer', 'trouble', 'weather', 'increase', 'suggesting', 'spurred', 'become', 'edge', 'surge', 'hand', 'walking', 'appetite', 'used', 'thirdgeneration', 'margin', 'butterbased', 'virulent', 'rising', 'faced', 'insolvency', 'might', 'impact', 'mère', 'proportion', 'descamps', 'person', 'revolution', 'game', 'steves', 'product', 'signal', 'recordhigh', 'colleague', 'squeezed', 'raised', 'traditionally', 'million', 'confectioner', 'country', 'biscuit', 'coast', 'word', 'research', 'shy', 'toward', 'corner', 'dolfis', 'jelle', 'needed', 'adapt', 'smaller', 'harsh', 'according', 'occupation', 'famed', 'folded', 'thats', 'variety', 'longerterm', 'arrondissement', 'take', 'operation', 'largely', 'processing', 'next', 'much', 'due', 'history', 'industry', 'enabled', 'massmarket', 'even', 'risk', 'general', 'outlet', 'dumons', 'occupied', 'cover', 'quarter', 'small', 'time', 'nearly', 'turned', 'scale', 'ivory', 'felt', 'supply', 'cut', 'across', 'hasnt', 'putting', 'high', 'bigger', 'bankruptcy', 'ghana', 'visiting', 'steadily', 'hard', 'season', 'surplus', 'fewer', 'havent', 'largest', 'coupled', 'pressure', 'conference', 'owner', 'diversifying', 'africa', 'chase', 'source', 'decent', 'dumon', 'current', 'covered', 'international', 'jonathan', 'refocusing', 'show', 'leysieffer', 'increasing', 'business', 'survival', 'shortfall', 'association', 'pray', 'hershey', 'produced', 'revealed', 'giant', 'changed', 'make', 'managing', 'important', 'two', 'artisanal', 'gone', 'ingredient', 'lower', 'forecast', 'independent', 'metric', 'medieval', 'bruges', 'surging', 'cost', 'simply', 'anticipated', 'peer', 'calculation', 'degree', 'global', 'schokolade', 'effect', 'recipe', 'foresee', 'west', 'iconic', 'praline', 'tricky', 'disease', 'ahead', 'approach', 'help', 'sibling', 'government', 'nestle', 'dropping', 'took', 'away', 'find', 'switzerland', 'forward', 'skill', 'data', 'still', 'challenging', 'palm', 'producer', 'shea', 'shift', 'liquidated', 'tropical', 'resource', 'four', 'store', 'switch', 'family', 'butter', 'ownership', 'email', 'grappling', 'head', 'vanish', 'reassured', 'wafer', 'bunny', 'scary', 'sharp', 'tourist', 'analysis', 'tough', 'austria', 'closed', 'denting', 'confectionery', 'sell', 'dont', 'resulted', 'past', 'use', 'steve', 'decision', 'energy', 'colombia', 'firm', 'look', 'lindt', 'last', 'tradition', 'marzipan', 'course', 'highest', 'change', 'often', 'mozartinspired', 'moment', 'lose', 'thanks', 'chocolatier', 'absorb', 'retailer', 'sunflower', 'belgium', 'come', 'straight', 'cant', 'substituting', 'whats', 'rely', 'street', 'equivalent', 'responsible', 'ninth', 'forced', 'thought', 'longstanding', 'deficit', 'buying', 'one', 'knife', 'normal', 'response', 'serving', 'previously', 'late', 'fall', 'busy', 'customer', 'force', 'selling', 'centre', 'produce', 'jpmorgan', 'christmas', 'least', 'however', 'raw', 'city', 'looking', 'respite', 'disappearing', 'trying', 'decline', 'charge', 'traditional', 'demand', 'alternative', 'capital', 'measure', 'service', 'adding', 'higher', 'price', 'hauswirth', 'need', 'declared', 'london', 'swiss', 'germany', 'nougat', 'mondelez', 'franz', 'people', 'south', 'climate', 'fourth', 'money', 'roman', 'roughly', 'sized', 'america', 'experienced', 'cheaper', 'wait', 'shortage', 'inc', 'destruction', 'seeing', 'lay', 'fuel', 'generate', 'many', 'level', 'new', 'pound', 'lost', 'per', 'biggest', 'adjust', 'hit', 'grind', 'dozen', 'spruengli', 'austrian', 'pressing', 'feb', 'passed', 'mouth', 'quickly', 'around', 'november', 'ride', 'wateridge', 'popular', 'lowest', 'korter', 'factory', 'food', 'director', 'trimming', 'year', 'hike', 'estimate', 'powder', 'driven', 'french', 'may', 'difficult', 'could', 'significantly', 'underestimated', 'endured', 'also', 'likelihood', 'since', 'area', 'paris', 'europe', 'continues', 'production', 'fallen', 'group', 'tight', 'reluctant', 'explained', 'salzburg', 'earlier', 'long', 'bulk', 'bean', 'german', 'everything', 'competitive', 'filed', 'chocolate', 'really', 'closing', 'record', 'case', 'citing', 'ton', 'improved', 'chocolatiers', 'raise', 'disruption', 'parisian', 'york', 'enormous', 'crop', 'afford', 'expensive', 'costly', 'lot', 'eggshell', 'brother', 'week', 'company', 'easter', 'imported', 'maker', 'share', 'century', 'dolfi', 'concern', 'half', 'reduce', 'shop', 'acute', 'artisan', 'said', 'mexico', 'billion', 'consumer', 'like']",Neutral

Reducing carbon emissions not only healthy for planet, but can also fuel economic growth: SM Teo

SINGAPORE - Transitioning away from fossil fuels is crucial not only for the health of the planet, but also for economic growth and prosperity of the people, Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean told Parliament on Feb 28.

For these reasons, countries, including Singapore, must press on to take climate action even though it is natural for them to ask why they should continue to do so when others are not, he said.

SM Teo, who is also Coordinating Minister for National Security and chairman of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change, was responding to a question from Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang GRC) on how political headwinds in the world will affect Singapore’s climate goals.

There will also be questions on whether their efforts will result in any meaningful change without the participation of bigger players, noted SM Teo.

The US – the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter after China – is pulling out of the Paris Agreement for the second time. This prompted other countries, like Argentina and Indonesia, to question the wisdom of maintaining their climate commitments.

But SM Teo said: “Climate change is no longer a future threat; it is already here with us.” Climate impacts are already being felt around the world, from widespread heatwaves to severe storms.

So, “the timeline to respond and adapt is being set not by us mere humans, but by nature”.

“Countries and businesses which lag behind will be forced to act eventually. The longer they wait, the sharper and more disruptive a transition they will have to make,” he said during the debate on the Prime Minister’s Office’s budget.

Pointing to economics being one of the drivers of climate mitigation, SM Teo said: “Green technology has advanced dramatically in the last two decades. Several of these technologies are now mature and mainstream, and make economic sense – they are not just cleaner but lower cost.”

The average cost of solar energy is now 50 per cent lower than that of fossil fuels.

“This explains why two-thirds of global energy investment in 2024 went to clean energy technologies and infrastructure,” said SM Teo.

“Despite political perturbations, there is now much greater momentum for decarbonisation than just a decade ago.

“Most of the world’s advanced economies have been investing in decarbonisation and steadily reducing emissions. They recognise that the green transition is an increasingly important driver of growth, and therefore crucial not just to the health of the globe, but also to the prosperity of their people,” he added.

A few MPs asked how businesses here will be supported through the green transition, and what costs and opportunities they will come across.

SM Teo pointed out that the Republic’s recently released 2035 climate targets generate demand for new green investments and give Singapore-based companies an edge in developing new low-carbon solutions.

By 2035, Singapore aims to reduce its emissions to between 45 million tonnes and 50 million tonnes, down from the 60 million tonnes it expects to emit in 2030. This puts the country on a linear trajectory to reach net-zero emissions in 2050, which means emissions are expected to decline steadily over time.

While the targets are ambitious, it also signals the country’s resolve to help the economy stay competitive in a low-carbon world, added SM Teo.

“Businesses and economies that remain emissions-intensive relative to their competitors will become less attractive. So, while there are costs in decarbonisation now, it is an investment in long-term survival and growth for our companies and also for Singapore’s economy,” he said.

SM Teo urged businesses to capture new markets in the green transition, as the demand for low-carbon goods and services will increase. Highlighting offshore wind as a potential area, he added that the global offshore wind market is expected to grow to US$126 billion (S$170 billion) per year by 2030.

He noted how Singapore companies in the oil and gas sector have been pivoting towards providing critical products and services across the offshore wind value chain.

SM Teo cited local company Cyan Renewables, which has grown since 2022 to become one of the largest offshore wind vessel owners globally, supporting clients across the Asia-Pacific and Europe.

Singapore has also been making strides with domestic solar energy.

Its solar energy capacity reached the 1.5 gigawatt-peak target by end-2024, a year ahead of schedule. Updating the House, SM Teo said this puts the country on track to achieve at least 2 gigawatt-peak of solar deployment by 2030, which can meet about 3 per cent of the country’s projected electricity demand.

While solar remains the country’s most viable renewable energy source, the Republic is still largely disadvantaged in renewable resources.

Hence, setting the 2035 target at a range of between 45 million and 50 million tonnes “reflects the practical reality that our pace of decarbonisation depends heavily on technological developments and international collaboration”, explained SM Teo.

On working with other countries, he also announced that Bhutan became the third country that Singapore can eventually buy carbon credits from, with a bilateral pact on carbon trading finalised on the morning of Feb 28.

This marks Singapore’s first carbon-trading pact with a carbon-negative country, as Bhutan is one of a few countries that absorb more greenhouse gases than they emit.

Since late 2023, Singapore has completed such agreements – formally called an implementation agreement – with Papua New Guinea and Ghana.

Buying carbon credits means that Singapore does not have to rely solely on cutting emissions domestically, but can offset its carbon footprint by investing in carbon projects elsewhere.

However, the Republic is expected to use these credits as a form of last resort, to shave off the residual emissions to meet its climate targets in 2035, and reach net zero in 2050.

Overall, Singapore is collaborating with more than 20 countries on carbon markets, most of which are at the initial stage. Countries it has signed an initial memorandum of understanding with include Malaysia, Colombia and Sri Lanka.

Other forms of international collaboration that Singapore is pushing for include importing green electricity from its neighbours to cover about a third of its electricity needs by 2035, and exploring cross-border carbon capture and storage.

The 2035 target also recognises that Singapore needs some flexibility to manage the impact of decarbonisation on households and businesses, while aligning with the pace of transition in the rest of the world, said SM Teo.

“We are neither climate zealots nor climate sceptics; we are climate realists. We cannot be sure what other countries will or will not do. But we will secure Singapore’s future – by doing our part to reduce emissions (and) by partnering our households and businesses in the transition,” he said.

Anwar, who is also minister of finance, said he had an online discussion with Arm’s chief executive officer (CEO) Friday morning.

He said Softbank Group Corp CEO Masayoshi Son also participated in the discussion.

SoftBank is a leading Japanese investment holding company.

“Insya-Allah, we will finalise the agreement next week, and it will be signed,” he told the media after launching the Malaysia Madani logo placement ceremony at the Putrajaya Nasi Kandar Restaurant chain here on Friday.

Earlier, while speaking after Friday prayers at the Sultan Alam Shah School Mosque, Anwar said that Arm is among the best in the world in terms of semiconductor design and manufacturing.

“Arm has chosen to base itself in Malaysia, Alhamdulillah,” he said.

Meanwhile, Anwar highlighted that such investments are only possible because Malaysia has political stability and clear policies.

However, he acknowledged that the arrival of such investments also presents challenges for the country in ensuring an adequate supply of young, professional workforce.

“This is a major test — can we provide tens of thousands of young professionals?

“This is a challenge for the youth. A professional workforce is essential when we attract significant investments,” he said.

Arm Holdings Plc is a semiconductor and software design company based in Cambridge, England. Its main business is designing central processing unit (CPU) architectures that implement the Arm instruction set.",1.74079E+12,en,0.298313737,2025-02-28 09:07:22,"['minister', 'stability', 'online', 'supply', 'feb', 'ibrahim', 'policy', 'central', 'ceo', 'ensuring', 'arrival', 'present', 'seri', 'participated', 'acknowledged', 'expected', 'insyaallah', 'officer', 'chain', 'putrajaya', 'friday', 'investment', 'ten', 'plc', 'restaurant', 'political', 'prayer', 'world', 'term', 'essential', 'madani', 'finalise', 'son', 'placement', 'attract', 'also', 'based', 'adequate', 'england', 'cambridge', 'workforce', 'ceremony', 'business', 'highlighted', 'united', 'group', 'major', 'medium', 'instruction', 'earlier', 'possible', 'meanwhile', 'datuk', 'significant', 'set', 'architecture', 'clear', 'announced', 'test', 'kingdom', 'design', 'discussion', 'kandar', 'sultan', 'challenge', 'cpu', 'thousand', 'chosen', 'youth', 'provide', 'however', 'agreement', 'designing', 'base', 'sign', 'morning', 'among', 'unit', 'leading', 'manufacturing', 'nasi', 'mosque', 'professional', 'semiconductor', 'country', 'corp', 'softbank', 'young', 'software', 'alam', 'best', 'executive', 'week', 'company', 'main', 'finance', 'speaking', 'masayoshi', 'shah', 'alhamdulillah', 'launching', 'anwar', 'japanese', 'school', 'processing', 'next', 'chief', 'establish', 'malaysia', 'said', 'prime', 'holding', 'arm', 'signed', 'logo', 'told', 'implement']",Neutral

She said this achievement places Malaysia among the fastest countries in the world in terms of expanding communication access in recent years.

Teo also noted a significant increase in 5G adoption among the public, with the percentage of users rising to 53.35 per cent compared to 24.6 per cent last year.

“4G network coverage in Johor, meanwhile, has reached 99.9 per cent as of Dec 31 last year,” she told a press conference after officiating the closing ceremony of the Future Health 4 All (FH4A) programme at Dewan Raya Putra here today.

The Kulai MP said these advancements could greatly benefit the healthcare sector, particularly in digital monitoring and screening, realising 5G’s full potential in enhancing healthcare services.

On the FH4A pilot programme, Teo said it is a strategic initiative designed to integrate cutting-edge technology into healthcare services, ensuring inclusivity and equal access to medical care.

“Our goal with this programme is to raise public awareness about health and demonstrate how we can use the latest technology for health screenings and monitoring. Many advanced medical devices are now available for faster and more accurate screening results.

Meanwhile, on the Malaysian Media Council (MMC) Bill 2024, which was passed in the Dewan Rakyat on Wednesday, Teo expressed hope that all media industry players would support the formation of the council.

She said it was an important step in establishing a platform for media practitioners, industry representatives and the government to collaborate.

“I would like to thank the members of parliament who supported the bill. The idea of creating a Malaysian Media Council was first proposed by the second Prime Minister in 1973, and it has taken us 52 years to bring this proposal to fruition,” she added. — Bernama",1.74079E+12,en,0.809740722,2025-02-28 10:06:12,"['per', 'full', 'deputy', 'minister', 'officiating', 'supported', 'sector', 'feb', 'ching', 'passed', 'accurate', 'particularly', 'achievement', 'pilot', 'demonstrate', 'ensuring', 'greatly', 'medical', 'step', 'cent', 'use', 'bill', 'collaborate', 'conference', 'coverage', 'healthcare', 'care', 'representative', 'last', 'proposed', 'putra', 'taken', 'world', 'year', 'bring', 'establishing', 'programme', 'term', 'network', 'council', 'integrate', 'inclusivity', 'hope', 'member', 'added', 'idea', 'malaysian', 'proposal', 'could', 'increase', 'monitoring', 'fha', 'also', 'area', 'enhancing', 'dewan', 'populated', 'ceremony', 'wednesday', 'potential', 'today', 'medium', 'reached', 'benefit', 'latest', 'rising', 'place', 'player', 'meanwhile', 'significant', 'rakyat', 'expanding', 'nie', 'thank', 'fruition', 'important', 'technology', 'parliament', 'platform', 'kulai', 'december', 'advanced', 'dec', 'future', 'closing', 'fastest', 'among', 'raise', 'support', 'noted', 'device', 'adoption', 'mmc', 'practitioner', 'result', 'health', 'service', 'bernama', 'first', 'country', 'raya', 'access', 'creating', 'digital', 'screening', 'would', 'faster', 'recent', 'compared', 'cuttingedge', 'public', 'awareness', 'second', 'government', 'communication', 'equal', 'goal', 'realising', 'strategic', 'user', 'initiative', 'available', 'advancement', 'industry', 'percentage', 'formation', 'malaysia', 'said', 'many', 'expressed', 'designed', 'prime', 'teo', 'johor', 'told', 'press', 'like']",Positive

This flagship smartphone comes with notable hardware upgrades, enhancing display quality, performance, and camera capabilities.

The Xiaomi 15 Ultra features a 6.73-inch AMOLED display with a 3200×1440 resolution, ensuring a sharp and immersive viewing experience. It supports a dynamic refresh rate ranging from 1Hz to 120Hz, adapting to different content needs while optimizing battery efficiency. With a peak brightness of 3,200 nits, the screen remains highly visible even in bright outdoor conditions. Protection is provided by Xiaomi’s Shield Glass 2.0, enhancing durability against scratches and impacts.

The smartphone is available in Black and White color options, along with a Silver Chrome Edition that incorporates aerospace-grade glass fiber and PU leather. This special edition not only offers a premium feel but is also the heaviest variant, weighing 229g with a thickness of 9.48mm.

Powering the Xiaomi 15 Ultra is the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, delivering top-tier performance for both everyday tasks and demanding applications. The device is available in 12GB or 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM, ensuring smooth multitasking and responsiveness. Storage options include 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB of UFS 4.1, offering ample space for apps, photos, and videos.

The battery capacity of the Xiaomi 15 Ultra stands at 6,000mAh, providing long-lasting power for extensive use. The device supports 90W wired charging, allowing for quick recharges, while 80W wireless charging offers a convenient alternative for users who prefer cable-free charging.

The Xiaomi 15 Ultra runs on Android 15, enhanced with Xiaomi’s HyperOS 2. This latest software version introduces improvements in system navigation, security features, and AI-driven functionalities. HyperCore enhances overall performance, while HyperAI integrates various smart tools, including AI writing assistance, text summarization, transcription, and translation capabilities. Xiaomi guarantees four generations of Android updates and six years of security patches, ensuring long-term software support for the Xiaomi 15 series.

The camera system, co-engineered with Leica, retains its quad-camera setup with significant improvements. The primary camera features a 50MP 1-inch Sony LYT-900 sensor with a 23mm lens, now using a fixed f/1.63 aperture, replacing the variable f/1.6-f/4.0 aperture from the previous model.

The mid-zoom module still incorporates the 1/2.51-inch IMX858 sensor, but now comes with a 70mm f/1.8 lens instead of the previous 75mm focal length. The ultrawide camera has been updated, transitioning from a 12mm f/1.8 lens to a 14mm f/2.2 lens, while retaining the 1/2.51-inch Samsung JN5 sensor for high-quality wide-angle shots.

The most notable improvement is in the telephoto lens, where Xiaomi introduces a 100mm f/2.6 periscope lens paired with a 200MP Samsung HP9 1/1.4-inch sensor. This marks a major advancement over the previous 120mm zoom camera, which used a smaller 1/2.51-inch sensor. For selfies, the Xiaomi 15 Ultra includes a 32MP 21mm f/2.0 front camera, delivering detailed and high-quality self-portraits.

Pricing for the Xiaomi 15 Ultra in China starts at CNY6,499 (RM3,985) for the 12GB/256GB variant. The 16GB/512GB model is priced at CNY6,999 (RM4,292), while the 16GB/1TB option costs CNY7,799 (RM4,782).

To complement its advanced camera system, Xiaomi has introduced a Photography Kit accessory, priced at CNY999 (RM612), which enhances the Ultra model’s imaging capabilities.

outbreak,How to see rare ‘planetary parade’ in the sky tonight,1.74075E+12,The Malaysian Reserve,https://themalaysianreserve.com/2025/02/28/how-to-see-rare-planetary-parade-in-the-sky-tonight/,https://news.google.com/read/CBMimwFBVV95cUxNWjFFSm92Mm1kaVdJaWt5UzVROGlrRlZvNnVmN29zbExXc25YbWFaaEJrSGdjOGMwZmNvT29TdDJVQ3ZoMWhoWHJJX19LVE5zVUZKeVZ1Mk1BSzBHcXNwVnZURFpOQ1A2VFpJTi04elRrV2NkeDRKZEF6azRKbWZqZ3piODItalg2RElWNUc3Q0JEdXFmYmhlOV9ZMA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://themalaysianreserve.com/2025/02/28/how-to-see-rare-planetary-parade-in-the-sky-tonight/,"PARIS – The seven other planets in our solar system will line up in the night sky on Friday evening for a rare alignment called a “planetary parade” that will not happen again until 2040.

Here is what you need to know about how best to get a glimpse of this celestial parade.

What is happening exactly?

All eight planets in the solar system orbit the Sun at different speeds but on roughly the same plane.

This is because the planets are thought to have been formed by a massive ring of gas and dust around 4.6 billion years ago — and they just kept on circling around that track.

“Every so often, when everything works out right, they all appear on the same side” of Earth, which makes them all visible in the sky at once, David Armstrong, an exoplanet researcher at the University of Warwick in the UK, told AFP.

This means that the planets look like a straightish line from our viewpoint on Earth — but are not actually in a straight line across the solar system.

That can happen but is even more rare, Armstrong said, adding it was of interest in a “science fiction” way than for hard science.

How can I see this parade?

“Step outside and look up,” Armstrong said simply. The best time to see most of the planets in the Northern Hemisphere will be just after sunset on Friday.

The further north from the equator you live, the better view you are likely to have, he added.

A clear sky will also be key — no certainty in the Northern Hemisphere’s winter — and being in a dark area away from city lights is a bonus.

But seeing all seven planets will require a telescope or strong binoculars.

Which planets are easiest to see?

First look out for Venus, which should be the brightest thing in the sky at twilight, Armstrong said.

Also easy to spot will be the noticeably red Mars and massive Jupiter, both of which are relatively close to the famous Orion constellation.

Mercury will be “just visible where the Sun is setting for a short period of time,” said astronomy education officer Jessica Lee, of the Royal Observatory Greenwich in London.

Both Mercury and Venus appear near the horizon because both planets are closer to the Sun than Earth, Armstrong observed.

Yellowy Saturn, which will appear just above the horizon as the Sun is setting, will be more tricky.

“You might be able to see it if you have a clear view of the western horizon,” Lee said.

Neptune and Uranus, which sit in the freezing, far-off outer solar system, will require a telescope or high-powered binoculars to get a good look at.

Faint Uranus will be close to Jupiter, Lee said.

If you do have a telescope, Armstrong recommended also searching out Jupiter’s Galilean moons.

“They look like little diamonds around the side of the planet,” Armstrong said.

Some of Jupiter’s moons are thought to have massive oceans hiding under their icy shells, making them prime targets in the search of extra-terrestrial life in our solar system.

What if there are clouds?

While the planetary parade technically aligns on the last day of February, many of the planets have already been visible for weeks.

And many including Jupiter, Mars, Venus and Saturn will still be visible in the sky for days to come.

“It’s absolutely not like this night or never,” Armstrong said.

But for Friday, weather will be key.

“Just hope for a clear night,” Armstrong said. –AFP",1.74079E+12,en,0.297734618,2025-02-28 12:30:51,"['time', 'formed', 'across', 'work', 'side', 'earth', 'dust', 'massive', 'including', 'moon', 'period', 'venus', 'appear', 'way', 'track', 'hard', 'happening', 'galilean', 'light', 'around', 'gas', 'ago', 'step', 'strong', 'noticeably', 'alignment', 'officer', 'friday', 'rare', 'visible', 'already', 'look', 'celestial', 'last', 'absolutely', 'year', 'often', 'mar', 'live', 'researcher', 'added', 'orion', 'hope', 'horizon', 'faint', 'weather', 'relatively', 'come', 'astronomy', 'university', 'like', 'straight', 'aligns', 'straightish', 'also', 'area', 'easiest', 'good', 'paris', 'key', 'armstrong', 'exoplanet', 'outside', 'jessica', 'different', 'science', 'thought', 'afp', 'mean', 'greenwich', 'royal', 'yellowy', 'technically', 'setting', 'easy', 'know', 'target', 'highpowered', 'northern', 'might', 'searching', 'called', 'diamond', 'clear', 'search', 'twilight', 'near', 'plane', 'view', 'binoculars', 'make', 'winter', 'sun', 'everything', 'neptune', 'hiding', 'night', 'bonus', 'never', 'see', 'observatory', 'life', 'viewpoint', 'certainty', 'city', 'fiction', 'get', 'warwick', 'evening', 'observed', 'education', 'planet', 'sky', 'equator', 'simply', 'happen', 'little', 'famous', 'adding', 'first', 'need', 'exactly', 'faroff', 'close', 'uranus', 'short', 'london', 'sunset', 'circling', 'brightest', 'lee', 'telescope', 'parade', 'david', 'constellation', 'every', 'freezing', 'able', 'thing', 'best', 'sit', 'closer', 'extraterrestrial', 'kept', 'icy', 'week', 'tricky', 'jupiter', 'ring', 'outer', 'interest', 'cloud', 'right', 'roughly', 'north', 'hemisphere', 'system', 'planetary', 'february', 'red', 'day', 'away', 'saturn', 'glimpse', 'seeing', 'likely', 'line', 'seven', 'eight', 'mercury', 'still', 'require', 'western', 'said', 'many', 'dark', 'spot', 'ocean', 'orbit', 'even', 'billion', 'prime', 'making', 'solar', 'shell', 'speed', 'told', 'recommended', 'better', 'actually']",Neutral

According to foreign media reports, the crescent moon of Ramadan was not sighted in several countries, including Malaysia and Singapore. As a result, the first fast of the holy month will be observed on Sunday in these regions.

Similarly, Australia and Brunei have also announced that the first fast will be on Sunday, following the absence of moon sighting reports.

Meanwhile, the Ramadan moon was not sighted in Lucknow, India, according to Indian media reports. Similarly, Sri Lanka also did not confirm the sighting of the crescent.

However, the Indonesian government officially announced the sighting of the moon, confirming that the first fast will be observed in the country tomorrow (Sunday). Indonesian media reported that the government’s announcement came half an hour later than the scheduled time.

Authorities in these countries rely on official moon sighting committees and astronomical calculations to determine the beginning of the Islamic month. With the moon not visible, Ramadan will commence a day later than in regions where the crescent was spotted.

The moon of Ramazan has been sighted in Saudi Arabia, marking the beginning of the holy month. According to details, the first day of fasting will be observed tomorrow, Saturday, March 1.

On the other hand, the Central Ruet-e-Hilal Committee of Pakistan, led by Maulana Abdul Khabir Azad, convened in Peshawar to sight the Ramadan moon. Zonal committees across major cities, including Lahore, Karachi, Quetta, and Islamabad, also held meetings to assess moon sighting reports.

According to officials, the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO) utilized digital telescopes nationwide, linking their stations via video in Peshawar to aid in crescent observation. Representatives from the Met Department and scholars from various sects participated in the deliberations.

The Met Department reported cloudy conditions in several cities, including Islamabad, Lahore, and Quetta, reducing the likelihood of spotting the moon.",1.74079E+12,en,-0.118021928,2025-02-28 13:56:51,"['time', 'following', 'later', 'meeting', 'cloudy', 'indonesian', 'across', 'suparco', 'including', 'moon', 'khabir', 'central', 'indian', 'video', 'saturday', 'india', 'confirm', 'space', 'australia', 'condition', 'station', 'ramadan', 'participated', 'brunei', 'announcement', 'representative', 'convened', 'upper', 'visible', 'month', 'crescent', 'nationwide', 'atmosphere', 'saudi', 'lanka', 'held', 'confirming', 'islamabad', 'committee', 'ruetehilal', 'rely', 'also', 'likelihood', 'deliberation', 'zonal', 'official', 'islamic', 'sighted', 'tomorrow', 'hand', 'astronomical', 'fasting', 'lucknow', 'spotting', 'major', 'medium', 'utilized', 'similarly', 'meanwhile', 'announced', 'met', 'abdul', 'detail', 'led', 'linking', 'determine', 'commission', 'pakistan', 'karachi', 'however', 'lahore', 'city', 'ramazan', 'observed', 'region', 'observation', 'result', 'calculation', 'authority', 'first', 'file', 'country', 'sighting', 'telescope', 'scholar', 'research', 'digital', 'reported', 'quetta', 'commence', 'report', 'via', 'fast', 'according', 'arabia', 'half', 'government', 'scheduled', 'sect', 'hour', 'spotted', 'maulana', 'day', 'holy', 'foreign', 'singapore', 'aid', 'came', 'absence', 'sri', 'sight', 'marking', 'assess', 'officially', 'various', 'several', 'malaysia', 'department', 'photo', 'beginning', 'reducing', 'sunday', 'azad', 'peshawar', 'march']",Neutral

Speaking at a post-Cabinet press conference on Friday (Feb 28), Fahmi, who is also the government spokesman, emphasised that representatives in MMC would not include politicians.

""Many councils, not just the media council (MMC), have government representatives. So this is not an issue, and we have discussed the matter with the pro-tem committee that drafted the proposal.

""They must be media professionals, such as those from Bernama or RTM. So I do not see this as unusual. The intention is to facilitate the process if there is any feedback,"" he said.

Reports indicate that at least 10 media-related organisations support the establishment of MMC but oppose the inclusion of government representatives on its board.

This concern has been voiced by the Centre for Independent Journalism (CIJ), ARTICLE 19, Gerakan Media Merdeka (Geramm), Justice for Sisters (JFS), Suara Rakyat Malaysia (Suaram), Sinar Project, Amnesty International Malaysia, Malaysian Centre for Constitutionalism and Human Rights (MCCHR), National Union of Journalists Peninsular Malaysia (NUJM) and KRYSS Network.

Other supporting organisations include the North South Initiative, Pusat Komas, the Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections (Bersih), Siuman Collective, and the Selangor Community Awareness Association (Empower).

On Feb 26, the Dewan Rakyat passed the Malaysian Media Council Bill 2024, aimed at ensuring media freedom and guaranteeing that the public receives accurate, credible and fair information.

Deputy Communications Minister Teo Nie Ching, when winding up the debate on the bill, said the provision for two government representatives in the MMC board was made because it is a statutory body established under government legislation and falls under the Communications Ministry.

In another development regarding the Gig Workers Bill, Fahmi said the matter was discussed in the Cabinet meeting, and Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim has instructed Human Resources Minister Steven Sim to gather feedback from all stakeholders before bringing the draft bill back to the Cabinet.

""We hope the engagement process and issue review can be completed, and we aim to table the bill in Parliament this year,"" he said.

Several gig economy service providers have urged the government to refine the Bill before presenting it in Parliament to ensure its implementation is clear, practical and does not disrupt the flexible employment ecosystem. – Bernama",1.74079E+12,en,-0.098405227,2025-02-28 13:11:00,"['minister', 'deputy', 'supporting', 'meeting', 'sim', 'peninsular', 'clean', 'siuman', 'provision', 'feb', 'organisation', 'sinar', 'ching', 'passed', 'accurate', 'ibrahim', 'suaram', 'suara', 'say', 'refine', 'ensuring', 'employment', 'unusual', 'collective', 'gig', 'seri', 'draft', 'include', 'board', 'facilitate', 'inclusion', 'bill', 'instructed', 'conference', 'matter', 'putrajaya', 'friday', 'another', 'intention', 'amnesty', 'representative', 'worker', 'completed', 'postcabinet', 'fadzil', 'year', 'aimed', 'pusat', 'journalism', 'flexible', 'must', 'network', 'council', 'hope', 'mediarelated', 'feedback', 'article', 'cij', 'malaysian', 'proposal', 'fahmi', 'committee', 'international', 'constitutionalism', 'komas', 'also', 'union', 'winding', 'coalition', 'receives', 'dewan', 'merdeka', 'nujm', 'emphasised', 'guaranteeing', 'regarding', 'jfs', 'bringing', 'stakeholder', 'medium', 'ministry', 'drafted', 'association', 'rakyat', 'datuk', 'clear', 'nie', 'freedom', 'fall', 'issue', 'selangor', 'two', 'parliament', 'table', 'centre', 'fair', 'protem', 'news', 'see', 'sister', 'least', 'independent', 'debate', 'agency', 'legislation', 'support', 'development', 'bersih', 'mmc', 'practitioner', 'engagement', 'information', 'service', 'bernama', 'gerakan', 'credible', 'professional', 'cabinet', 'journalist', 'voiced', 'election', 'body', 'statutory', 'steven', 'indicate', 'ensure', 'provider', 'disrupt', 'practical', 'south', 'ecosystem', 'justice', 'report', 'national', 'implementation', 'made', 'community', 'would', 'review', 'human', 'right', 'discussed', 'concern', 'speaking', 'televisyen', 'oppose', 'north', 'awareness', 'public', 'politician', 'government', 'geramm', 'empower', 'aim', 'economy', 'gather', 'communication', 'spokesman', 'anwar', 'kryss', 'rtm', 'radio', 'initiative', 'mcchr', 'presenting', 'establishment', 'back', 'several', 'malaysia', 'said', 'many', 'project', 'established', 'prime', 'teo', 'urged', 'process', 'resource', 'press']",Neutral

The Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) projects that the digital economy will contribute 25.5% to Malaysia's GDP by 2025, up from 22.6% in 2022. Strategic investments by both government and private sectors in AI, cybersecurity, and digital infrastructure underpin this growth.

Georg Chmiel, Executive Chairman of Chmiel Global Advisory, highlighted Malaysia's leadership in AI, stating, ""Malaysia is at the forefront of adopting artificial intelligence in Southeast Asia. Artificial intelligence transforms industries from healthcare to finance to manufacturing and creates new possibilities."" The government has earmarked MYR 20 million in its 2024 budget towards a national AI framework, expected to generate over 500,000 high-value digital jobs by 2030.

Chmiel noted that companies such as BrioHR and Juwai IQI are exemplary in utilising AI to innovate within their sectors. ""Prime examples of companies that are very well-positioned to leverage this technology include BrioHR, which leverages artificial intelligence to automate HR practices, and Juwai IQI, which applies artificial intelligence analytics to real estate,"" he said.

Malaysia is also prioritising cybersecurity to address the growing risks associated with digital reliance. ""With great digital growth comes great responsibility—and Malaysia is taking proactive measures to address this,"" Chmiel explained. The country is paying particular attention to emerging threats, including quantum-related risks, through initiatives like the RM50 million allocation for AI and cybersecurity research in Budget 2025.

Chmiel emphasised the importance of trust in the digital economy, remarking, ""You can't have a thriving digital economy without trust. Malaysia's focus on cybersecurity isn't just about protecting businesses and consumers—it's about building confidence in the digital space."" Establishing the Malaysian Cryptology Technology and Management Centre in collaboration with Universiti Putra Malaysia and the National Cyber Security Agency is a part of these efforts.

Major global companies like Oracle actively invest in Malaysia, signaling confidence in the nation's high-tech potential. ""Malaysia has everything going for it—great infrastructure, good talent pool, and business-friendly policies,"" said Chmiel. ""It's no wonder Malaysia's tech sector is expected to grow by 8-10% annually by 2025, driven by investments in AI, cybersecurity, and digital infrastructure.""

His Majesty Sultan Ibrahim, King of Malaysia, has endorsed government efforts to bolster foreign investment in the technology sectors, highlighting its role in creating quality jobs and building the economy.

Budget 2025 reaffirms Malaysia's commitment to digital transformation, allocating MYR 1.5 billion for digital infrastructure improvements, including 5G expansion and broadband upgrades, and MYR 200 million for upskilling initiatives focusing on digital literacy and AI expertise. Tax incentives are also offered to companies investing in AI, cybersecurity, and green technology sectors.

Chmiel expressed his optimism for the future: ""Malaysia's journey toward digital transformation is truly inspiring. By embracing AI and cybersecurity, the nation is enhancing its economic competitiveness and quality of life.""

The 2.61-acre freehold land on Jalan Ampang, Kuala Lumpur, that was previously home to SJKC Lai Meng will be soon developed into a mixed-use project called Armani Hallson KLCC by the Armani Group.

Chris Yong, deputy CEO of the Armani Group, says the development consists of small office home office (SoHo) and small office versatile office (SoVo) units, and has an estimated gross development value (GDV) of RM3 billion.

“We are extremely excited about this project; it’s one of our most iconic to date,” he says in an interview with City & Country, adding that the targeted launch date is in May.

Armani Hallson KLCC will feature 775 SoHo units in one block (the 68-storey Block C) and 1,440 SoVo units in two blocks (the 78-storey Block A and B). The SoHo units range from 538 to 558 sq ft, while the SoVo units range from 406 to 1,182 sq ft. Prices start at RM1,600 psf.

The land was acquired by Magna Prima Bhd’s (KL:MAGNA) wholly-owned subsidiary Twinicon (M) Sdn Bhd from the Lai Meng Girls School Association in 2014 for RM148.15 million. In January last year, Magna Prima announced its collaboration with Golden Rainbow View Sdn Bhd — a subsidiary of Armani Group — to jointly develop the project.

Luxurious living

Maria Wan Malek, COO of Armani Group, says Armani Hallson KLCC is distinguished by its concept of luxurious living in a tropical resort setting. The development features ample facilities, including a 30,000 sq ft tropical garden on Level 10.

“We aim to introduce a new living concept for our residents. On Level 10, we have a tranquil lagoon, waterfall, floating steps, floating tea pavilion, zen garden, barbecue lounge, lawn, herb garden and more,” says Maria.

“The tropical garden is designed for the residents to avoid a claustrophobic feel, especially for [those in] units facing each other when they look down from their units. We’re the first to create this kind of urban living with a beautiful garden that features a waterfall and a glass-covered passage running through it. By offering these views, we want to create a sense of tranquillity.”

She adds that this is a departure from conventional offerings by other developers, as it ensures that no matter the direction or view from a unit, there is always something exciting to look at.

To further emphasise the luxury theme, Armani Hallson KLCC offers over 80 types of facilities on various levels, including an open terrace on SoHo block Level 33; swimming pool and Jacuzzi on SoHo block Level 67; gymnasium on SoHo block Level 68; swimming pool, Jacuzzi, onsen, hydro spa and heated pool on SoVo blocks Level 76; multipurpose hall and gymnasium on SoVo blocks Level 77; and viewing deck on SoVo block Level 78.

Maria highlights that the sky-level facilities in the SoVo blocks will provide breathtaking panoramic views of the Kuala Lumpur skyline, showcasing all four iconic skyscrapers — the Petronas Twin Towers, The Exchange 106, Merdeka 118 and KL Tower. The estimated maintenance fee, inclusive of the sinking fund, is 95 sen psf.

“SoHo residents can use the facilities in the SoVo blocks, but not the other way around,” she adds.

On the difference between SoHos and SoVos, Yong says the former fall under the Housing Development Act, making them suitable for residential living, while the latter do not. However, due to market demand, many people choose to live in SoVo units (judging from registrations).

“The Ministry of Housing and Local Government (KPKT) does not prohibit people from residing in SoVo units as long as the majority of the purchasers agree. We have voluntarily informed KPKT of our intention to allow buyers to live in the SoVos,” he says.

As a transit-oriented development, Armani Hallson KLCC will have covered walkways connecting it to the Bukit Nanas monorail station and the Petronas Twin Towers, which in turn offer access to the KLCC LRT station.

“We opened for registration in March, and the response was very positive. Our target market includes both local and international owner-occupiers and investors. Based on the response to our previous projects, we are confident in selling out this development,” says Yong.

Relationship with Magna Prima

Founded in 2010, the Ipoh-based Armani Group is led by Datuk Seri Bryan Wong Sze Chien and Datuk Seri Azlan Azmi. The company is involved in a diverse range of ventures in property development, construction, renewable energy, bakery, furniture and plantations.

The group also owns shares in several listed companies, such as Tafi Industries Bhd (KL:TAFI) and Scanwolf Corp Bhd (KL:SCNWOLF). Wong is also CEO of Tafi.

Yong says Armani Group’s relationship with Magna Prima began when it acquired land from the latter to develop the Armani Signature Residence at Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Golf and Country Club in Shah Alam, Selangor.

“We launched that project in November 2023, and now the take-up rate is over 80%. This built our confidence with Magna Prima, leading them to open up their pot of gold, the Lai Meng school land, for us to develop. Magna Prima is the landowner, and we have the full development rights.”

Wong and his partner Seah Ley Hong have emerged as substantial shareholders of property developer Magna Prima through their private vehicle, Edxus Solutions Sdn Bhd.

On Sept 27 last year, Edxus Solutions acquired 95 million shares or a 23.91% stake in Magna Prima via a direct business transaction, its filings with the stock exchange showed. Following the acquisition, Edxus Solutions has become the largest shareholder with 26.93% interest in Magna Prima.

RM4 billion worth of launches in 2025

Maria says Armani Group has planned RM15 billion in launches over the next five years, of which RM4 billion will be launched this year.

Among the launches for 2025 are mixed-use development Armani Putra in Dengkil, Selangor (GDV: RM350 million, 5.07 acres); commercial office lot development Armani Perdana in Damansara Perdana, Selangor (GDV: RM150 million, 0.994 acres); shoplot development Pekan Perdana Commercial Centre in Pahang (GDV: RM40 million, 6.116 acres); mixed-use development Armani Cheras, Kuala Lumpur (GDV: RM200 million, 0.59 acres); residential development Armani Avani in Sungai Long, Selangor (GDV: RM180 million, 4.096 acres); mixed-use development Setia Alam phase 2, Selangor (GDV: RM600 million, 4.98 acres); industrial development in Klang, Selangor (GDV: RM500 million, 9.32 acres) and Armani Hallson Bukit Bintang (GDV: RM2 billion, 1.69 acres).

“We don’t keep land for too long. That’s why we have plans for the next five years. Holding land for extended period strains cash flow,” says Maria.

The group has had numerous successful joint ventures, and Yong attributes these to a market-driven planning approach. “Before any land purchase, we engage with key stakeholders, such as bankers, valuers and marketing partners, to understand the area’s needs. Whether buyers want larger units with ample parking or easy access to public transport, understanding demographics is key to project success.”

“This disciplined approach leads to tangible results, with most recent launches achieving over 80% take-up rates, and some even reaching 90% within the first year,” Maria says.

Yong adds that this strategy allows Armani Group to manage the ongoing challenge of rising construction costs, ensuring efficient partnerships and cash flow management.

“We’re fortunate to have Vestland Bhd (KL:VLB) as our main construction partner. Their design-and-build model allows us to keep costs under control while managing project cash flow. This synergy is crucial as construction costs rise.”

Wong also owns a 0.74% stake in Vestland.

Another challenge lies in the increasingly stringent compliance requirements from local councils and regulatory bodies. While the group respects these regulations, Yong emphasises that they contribute to higher development costs. To address this, Armani Group stays actively engaged with local authorities to ensure policies remain practical and implementable.

Yong also points out that barriers to entry are growing more significant, increasingly turning the industry into a game dictated by economies of scale.

“The ability to control costs comes from volume and established relationships. Over the years, we’ve built strong partnerships with bankers, contractors and suppliers. These relationships are difficult for new players to replicate.”

An optimistic outlook

Yong is optimistic about the market outlook, pointing out that Armani Group’s planned launches for the year reflect this.

Despite the 24% tariff imposed by the US, he remains optimistic about Malaysia’s property market, particularly in the industrial and residential segments. As global companies seek alternatives to China and higher-tariff countries like Vietnam and Thailand, Malaysia remains relatively attractive due to its moderate tariff rate and exemptions. This may position Malaysia as a strategic base for regional operations, while nearby Singapore (with the lowest tariff in the region) could act as a re-export hub, indirectly benefitting Malaysia’s logistics and real estate sectors.

“From a domestic perspective, the government is expected to step in with supportive measures, including potential interest rate cuts to cushion any economic impact and sustain private consumption. Lower borrowing costs would make property purchases more attractive, particularly for local buyers and foreign investors under programmes like MM2H, which encourages foreign ownership of properties,” he says.

“While export driven sectors may face some headwinds in the short term until things settle down, the overall market can remain resilient, supported by Malaysia’s strong fundamentals, proactive policymaking and competitive intervention. These factors suggest that property demand — especially in industrial, commercial and housing segments — could remain steady, or even grow amid global trade tensions.”

?? ?? GS25 Vietnamese branch

The convenience store industry is also breaking new records in exports. While competing for the top spot in offline sales with department stores in Korea, it is rapidly expanding its territory by selling K-food and its own brand (PB) products overseas.

According to the distribution industry on the 2nd, GS25, the ""two-top"" of domestic convenience stores, and GS Retail and BGF Retail, the operators of CU, are both expected to export nearly $10 million this year.

GS Retail is likely to surpass $10 million in exports this year. Starting with about $180,000 (about 200 million won) in 2017, GS Retail has grown exports such as $3.4 million (about 3.9 billion won) in 2020 and $8.4 million (about 11 billion won) in 2022. Last year, it exceeded 9 million dollars (about 13.2 billion won). It has grown more than 65 times in seven years since its first export based on the won.

?? ??

In the selection of the Korea International Trade Association's ""Export Tower"" based on July of the previous year to June, the $10 million export gold tower is already confirmed this year.

GS Retail exports more than 600 products to more than 30 countries, including Europe, North America, the Middle East, and Africa, as well as Vietnam, Mongolia, and Indonesia, which have entered offline stores. Global retailers such as H Mart in the U.S., Park & Shop in Hong Kong, Carrefour in Taiwan, Top's Market in Thailand, and 7-Eleven in Singapore, local markets, and Korean markets are the main targets.

Among GS Retail's export products last year, more than 10 products affiliated with Netflix's Intellectual Property (IP), including ""Squid Game,"" accounted for $2 million, driving its performance. GS Retail's own brand (PB) products are also being exported around the world and are playing a role. ""Youers"" such as Omori Kimchi Stew Ramen and Republican Chun Black Bean Noodles are exported to 28 countries, and ""Real Price"" such as butter-galic shrimp chips and cheese balls is exported to 15 countries, respectively. This year, it plans to expand its exporting countries, focusing on the European and Asian markets.

GS25 plans to participate in the food fair ""Taipex"" and ""Sial China"" in Bangkok, Thailand, and Shanghai, China, respectively, in May to attract collaboration with global companies. Typex, attended by 80,000 people from more than 3,200 companies around the world, is the largest event in the Asia-Pacific region, and GS25 was the first domestic retailer to participate last year.

CU also expects exports to be more than $9 million this year. CU exports increased from $1.2 million in 2019 to $3.7 million in 2020 and $6.5 million in 2021 and exceeded $8 million for the second consecutive year starting in 2023.

For CU, regions that have entered offline stores such as Mongolia (460 points), Malaysia (150 points), and Kazakhstan (30 points) serve as outposts. In overseas stores, Korean products, including PB, account for 50% of total sales.

?? ?? Yonsei Milk Fresh Cream Bread [Photo = Yonsei Dairy]

Until last year, 230,000 units of the ""Yeonse Milk Cream Bread"" series, which was also popular in Korea, were exported to Mongolia alone. Korean-style black bean noodles (100,000) and hot bars (180,000) have also become hit products in Mongolia. Last year, about 90,000 Pepero were sold in Mongolia and Malaysia during Pepero Day. CU also exports PB products such as ramen, snacks, and beverages to more than 20 countries, including the U.S., China, the U.K., the Netherlands, Malaysia, and Ivory Coast.

CU has set up a PB stand in Don Quixote, Japan's largest general store, for the first time in the Korean industry, delivering 15 kinds of products, including PB cup noodles, laver, and cookies.

7-Eleven has established a 'global sourcing team' in 2023 and is conducting import and export in connection with 7-Eleven in each country. It is a method of importing and selling popular PB products of local 7-Eleven such as Japan, the United States, and Taiwan into Korea and exporting Korean products to overseas store networks.

7-Eleven has exported snacks, laver, and coffee to the United States (Hawaii), Taiwan, and Malaysia.

When more bays are allotted to motorists, the council hopes that the congestion in George Town can be subsequently reduced eventually.

MBPP also wants to encourage more road users to opt for the Rapid Penang public bus services, he said.

""The best option available now in reducing the present congestion is a higher take up rate for public transport from ride sharing to the stage public buses.""

Referring to the online debate which ensued after MBPP made a bold move to impose higher parking charges, Rajendran hopes that ratepayers would cooperate with the council in its efforts to mitigate the worsening daily gridlock here.

Traffic in Penang has taken a considerable turn for the worst after Covid - 19 with daily gridlocks in many parts of the state, including on the Prai mainland, which become profoundly severe during public and school holidays.

Under the new rates, the fees have increased from 40 sen to 60 sen per half hour, and from 80 sen to RM1.20 per hour.

The daily parking rate has also been revised from RM6 to RM9, while the monthly pass remains at RM150.

The new rates are published on the smart parking portal under MBPP.

Besides this, Rajendran said that the council also plans to impose a time parking limit on parts of Chulia Street and Little India soon in view of the congestion in the localities.

“Public parking should serve as a shared facility, not a private space for all-day parking. We will start limiting parking time in areas where finding a spot is already difficult.""

MBPP has also unveiled plans to control the traffic flow at Jalan P. Ramlee, Jalan Dato’ Keramat, Jalan Magazine, Jalan Burma and the Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu Expressway, by banning roadside waiting and increasing enforcement against illegal parking.

Rajendran, a traffic engineer, was instrumental in many of the island's public transport policies, especially in turning roads into one - way system to disperse traffic fast.

However, not all segments of the ratepayers are glad with the new parking charges.

Some shared their opinions, citing that the charges would only contribute to higher living costs, especially for the B40 low middle income groups, and retirees.

A retired hotelier, said that the traffic jams will continue to occur because the people have invested in cars in the first place.

""Unless the public transport improves, and the secondhand car market is able to allow trade - in at better selling rates, people will continue to drive their automobiles.""

And with the heatwave which comes with the climate change, the number of pedestrians on public roads, are also expected to fall in the coming years, said the hotelier. – March 3, 2025",1.74105E+12,en,-0.046798378,2025-03-03 00:45:00,"['unless', 'stage', 'per', 'mayor', 'time', 'roadside', 'online', 'allotted', 'occur', 'road', 'rapid', 'including', 'flow', 'policy', 'bold', 'bus', 'way', 'fee', 'profoundly', 'india', 'space', 'continue', 'soon', 'present', 'jalan', 'secondhand', 'market', 'trade', 'finding', 'move', 'ride', 'motorist', 'monthly', 'retiree', 'holiday', 'george', 'expected', 'start', 'heatwave', 'ensued', 'besides', 'town', 'covid', 'plan', 'severe', 'portal', 'already', 'month', 'published', 'option', 'coming', 'priority', 'taken', 'daily', 'shared', 'automobile', 'change', 'year', 'council', 'hope', 'difficult', 'limit', 'lord', 'mitigate', 'number', 'come', 'rajendran', 'serve', 'magazine', 'mainland', 'living', 'segment', 'middle', 'street', 'also', 'increasing', 'area', 'sharing', 'become', 'contribute', 'immediate', 'remains', 'especially', 'drive', 'one', 'group', 'revised', 'state', 'banning', 'place', 'enforcement', 'impose', 'datuk', 'control', 'referring', 'view', 'increased', 'unveiled', 'fall', 'make', 'improves', 'anthony', 'limiting', 'pedestrian', 'selling', 'prai', 'reduced', 'pas', 'however', 'debate', 'private', 'eventually', 'penang', 'smart', 'lim', 'city', 'chong', 'chulia', 'worsening', 'citing', 'income', 'charge', 'locality', 'dato', 'effort', 'illegal', 'cost', 'car', 'little', 'jam', 'glad', 'service', 'first', 'higher', 'allday', 'waiting', 'cooperate', 'bay', 'turn', 'retired', 'gridlock', 'traffic', 'considerable', 'sen', 'burma', 'subsequently', 'people', 'best', 'able', 'congestion', 'opt', 'climate', 'made', 'fast', 'island', 'would', 'low', 'ratepayer', 'facility', 'allow', 'disperse', 'encourage', 'public', 'system', 'want', 'part', 'half', 'tun', 'hour', 'parking', 'expressway', 'rate', 'invested', 'take', 'school', 'hotelier', 'user', 'ramlee', 'worst', 'keramat', 'available', 'said', 'many', 'spot', 'engineer', 'reducing', 'instrumental', 'new', 'turning', 'mbpp', 'march', 'better', 'transport', 'opinion']",Neutral

Malaysia expects its durian exports to China to grow by 20-25% this year amid increasing demand and expanding domestic production.

The projection is grounded in the ongoing expansion of farming land and processing facilities, and strengthened commercial relationships coupled with promotional initiatives, according to the Federal Agricultural Marketing Authority, as cited by The Star.

Several states are making moves to boost durian cultivation. One example is Kelantan, where 3,000 hectares have been designated for Musang King durian plantations, he said, referring to the famous durian variety that is mostly grown in Malaysia.

Durian farmers suggest that China's recent import restrictions on fresh durians coming from Vietnam and Thailand will further amplify the demand for Malaysian durians.

Sam Tan, president of the Malaysia Durian Exporters Association, has called on the government to enact a policy prohibiting the pre-cutting of durians to safeguard the integrity of Malaysian durian quality.

He said that farmers in Thailand and Vietnam often cut the fruit before they are ripe for more convenience in transportation.

Malaysian durians, however, are allowed to ripen naturally and are collected only after they have fallen from the tree.

Tan added that this natural ripening process results in a product free from chemicals, which is highly valued in markets like China.

Malaysia exported MYR24.8 million (US$5.5 million) worth of fresh durian to China in the last four months of 2024 after an export protocol between the two countries were signed in June.

By Linda Khoo KUALA LUMPUR, April 21 (Bernama) -- The mutual visa exemption agreement between China and Malaysia, inked during Chinese President Xi Jinping’s recent state visit, marks a significant milestone in deepening bilateral relations. Universiti Malaya political analyst Associate Professor Dr Awang Azman Awang Pawi described the agreement as a strategic move that facilitates seamless people-to-people exchanges and lays a strong foundation for closer ties between the two countries.

He said the visa-free arrangement also promotes broader cooperation, reinforcing the Malaysia-China Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and carrying positive implications for regional cooperation and development. Increased mobility, he added, is expected to spur Chinese investment in high-growth sectors throughout Malaysia. “The agreement paves the way for joint cultural initiatives, such as the collaborative nomination of the lion dance for UNESCO recognition.

“By strengthening bilateral ties, the agreement also contributes to regional stability and ASEAN cooperation, aligning with both countries' commitment to multilateralism,” he told Bernama. Awang Azman said the mutual visa exemption underscores the robust and evolving relationship between China and Malaysia. “It aligns with the vision of building a high-level strategic community with a shared future, emphasising mutual respect and cooperation.",1.74527E+12,en,0.616440415,2025-04-21 09:08:06,"['inked', 'robust', 'minister', 'seamless', 'stability', 'asean', 'carrying', 'sector', 'awang', 'china', 'jinping', 'ibrahim', 'respect', 'comprehensive', 'cooperation', 'way', 'malaysiachina', 'jinpings', 'foundation', 'peopletopeople', 'seri', 'move', 'mutual', 'strong', 'promotes', 'expected', 'recognition', 'unesco', 'complex', 'associate', 'pave', 'azman', 'lumpur', 'investment', 'nomination', 'political', 'world', 'throughout', 'underscore', 'shared', 'analyst', 'vision', 'witnessing', 'added', 'nasution', 'strengthening', 'aligning', 'aligns', 'cultural', 'fotobernama', 'also', 'exchange', 'highlevel', 'regional', 'emphasising', 'chinese', 'state', 'commitment', 'linda', 'significant', 'datuk', 'implication', 'positive', 'spur', 'mous', 'increased', 'facilitates', 'two', 'partnership', 'mark', 'described', 'dance', 'tie', 'professor', 'agreement', 'visit', 'joint', 'relationship', 'future', 'lion', 'perdana', 'development', 'milestone', 'exemption', 'saifuddin', 'reserved', 'building', 'bernama', 'visa', 'universiti', 'country', 'copyright', 'multilateralism', 'deepening', 'understanding', 'closer', 'memoranda', 'community', 'right', 'collaborative', 'recent', 'visafree', 'second', 'mobility', 'kuala', 'government', 'relation', 'broader', 'evolving', 'represented', 'anwar', 'foreign', 'strategic', 'home', 'contributes', 'wang', 'lay', 'initiative', 'reinforcing', 'april', 'pawi', 'malaysia', 'arrangement', 'president', 'bilateral', 'said', 'highgrowth', 'prime', 'khoo', 'left', 'malaya', 'ismail', 'told']",Positive

These species are at risk due to habitat loss, poaching and climate change, which jeopardise their existence. Experts stress the urgent need to protect Malaysia’s biodiversity, from the jungles of Peninsular Malaysia to the rainforests of Sabah and Sarawak, home to countless wildlife species.

According to WWF-Malaysia’s Head of Conservation - Peninsula & Conservation Science Dr Jason Hon, the Malayan tiger is critically endangered, with fewer than 150 left in the wild.

Poaching remains the greatest threat to these majestic animals.

“Their future depends on reducing poaching, protecting habitats and strengthening enforcement. While government initiatives have made progress, there is still much to be done. Collaboration between authorities, NGOs and local communities is crucial,” he said.

WWF-Malaysia’s Tiger Conservation Programme lead Azlan Mohamed said the organisation is working closely with local enforcement agencies and indigenous communities to monitor tiger populations.

“Efforts such as strengthened protection operations, increased patrolling and the establishment of wildlife corridors are vital for the species to survive,” he said.

Azlan also called for greater funding and support for the National Tiger Conservation Task Force, which leads preservation efforts.

“We need more resources to train and deploy rangers. Poaching remains a major threat and without proper monitoring, we risk losing these magnificent animals,”

he said.

Beyond Malayan tigers, other species, including the Malayan tapir, are also at risk of extinction.

WWF-Malaysia data estimates that only 1,300 to 1,700 Malayan tapirs remain, with 112 fatalities due to road crashes recorded between 2020 and March 2024.

Recent studies also suggest that only 1,000 Bornean elephants are left, with just 400 breeding adults.

The Raffles’ banded langur faces an even more dire situation, with fewer than 250 mature individuals remaining.

Observed annually on March 3, World Wildlife Day highlights the importance of preserving endangered species and their natural habitats.

WWF-Malaysia Sarawak Programme senior field biologist Lukmann Haqeem Alen said Sarawak’s jungles shelter critically endangered species, such as the Bornean orangutan and helmeted hornbill.

“While conservation has made some progress, illegal logging and land conversion remain persistent threats,” he said.

He urged for stricter penalties for illegal loggers and wildlife traffickers, with better incentives for local communities to support preservation efforts.

In Sabah, where deforestation and human-wildlife conflict continue to threaten many species, WWF-Malaysia Sabah Landscapes Programme and wildlife protection manager Sharon Koh called for better land management.

“Forest fragmentation due to plantation expansion has isolated species such as the Bornean elephant and Sunda clouded leopard. We are advocating better landscape connectivity to allow wildlife to move safely between habitats,” she said, stressing the importance of community engagement and corporate responsibility.

Meanwhile, Universiti Putra Malaysia Wildlife Management senior lecturer Dr Tengku Rinalfi Putra Tengku Azizan said urbanisation is forcing species, such as

long-tailed macaques, elephants and wild boars, into populated environments.

“Improved urban planning, with buffer zones and ecological corridors, is essential to ensure wildlife can access natural resources without encroaching on human spaces,” he said.

He added that climate change is disrupting wildlife behaviour, forcing large mammals and primates to alter their foraging patterns due to shifting food availability and unpredictable weather conditions.

“If we want true coexistence, we must integrate wildlife preservation into urban planning, rather than treating it as an afterthought.”",1.74105E+12,en,-0.5678128,2025-03-03 02:03:12,"['lead', 'beyond', 'strengthened', 'isolated', 'bornean', 'malayan', 'peninsular', 'annually', 'suggest', 'azizan', 'shelter', 'biologist', 'head', 'organisation', 'road', 'humanwildlife', 'including', 'disrupting', 'rinalfi', 'penalty', 'macaque', 'longtailed', 'preservation', 'stricter', 'task', 'space', 'encroaching', 'continue', 'conservation', 'conflict', 'protecting', 'alen', 'tiger', 'urban', 'ecological', 'condition', 'crucial', 'survive', 'move', 'fewer', 'greatest', 'mammal', 'tapir', 'adult', 'unpredictable', 'haqeem', 'train', 'closely', 'helmeted', 'collaboration', 'elephant', 'jason', 'face', 'dire', 'stress', 'severe', 'langur', 'vital', 'urbanisation', 'pattern', 'food', 'remaining', 'putra', 'mohamed', 'boar', 'world', 'poaching', 'change', 'estimate', 'programme', 'ranger', 'forcing', 'must', 'alter', 'essential', 'urgent', 'added', 'habitat', 'crash', 'integrate', 'strengthening', 'raffle', 'malaysian', 'responsibility', 'weather', 'voice', 'senior', 'activist', 'specie', 'progress', 'monitoring', 'protect', 'individual', 'also', 'preserving', 'logging', 'jeopardise', 'depends', 'management', 'lecturer', 'populated', 'conservationist', 'greater', 'remains', 'science', 'shifting', 'majestic', 'breeding', 'working', 'protection', 'plantation', 'survival', 'conversion', 'major', 'corporate', 'loss', 'enforcement', 'treating', 'petaling', 'meanwhile', 'sarawak', 'called', 'threat', 'increased', 'expansion', 'fatality', 'animal', 'wwfmalaysias', 'sharon', 'incentive', 'force', 'highlight', 'fragmentation', 'without', 'mark', 'natural', 'koh', 'logger', 'situation', 'rather', 'hon', 'future', 'improved', 'landscape', 'safely', 'agency', 'indigenous', 'azlan', 'observed', 'support', 'rainforest', 'effort', 'illegal', 'existence', 'jaya', 'persistent', 'planning', 'extinction', 'countless', 'manager', 'authority', 'engagement', 'magnificent', 'wild', 'need', 'done', 'corridor', 'plight', 'universiti', 'foraging', 'biodiversity', 'deforestation', 'access', 'patrolling', 'peninsula', 'stressing', 'ensure', 'losing', 'threaten', 'climate', 'ngo', 'trafficker', 'national', 'field', 'made', 'large', 'funding', 'community', 'jungle', 'remain', 'human', 'mature', 'expert', 'according', 'population', 'recent', 'study', 'deploy', 'concern', 'allow', 'monitor', 'advocating', 'coexistence', 'wildlife', 'want', 'government', 'recorded', 'buffer', 'behaviour', 'lukmann', 'hornbill', 'connectivity', 'endangered', 'day', 'sunda', 'leopard', 'operation', 'availability', 'orangutan', 'afterthought', 'environment', 'home', 'importance', 'local', 'forest', 'much', 'primate', 'sabah', 'initiative', 'proper', 'data', 'due', 'still', 'establishment', 'land', 'malaysia', 'said', 'critically', 'banded', 'many', 'true', 'reducing', 'clouded', 'even', 'risk', 'urged', 'left', 'resource', 'march', 'tengku', 'better', 'zone', 'wwfmalaysia']",Negative

Through the Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development Institute (MARDI), Malaysia has contributed several types of seeds to the Svalbard Global Seed Vault (SGSV) in Norway.

In a Facebook post by MARDI Malaysia, seeds from traditional rice, eggplant, and long bean varieties were selected as duplicates to be stored in SGSV.

The Doomsday Vault

The vault, also dubbed the Doomsday Vault, is built inside a mountain near Longyearbyen, at a depth of more than 120 meters, with a natural temperature of around -18°C to ensure the seeds remain in good condition for the long term.

The name “Doomsday Vault” comes from its function as a seed storage facility designed to withstand major disasters, including wars, climate change, or natural disasters that could threaten the world’s food supply.

“A total of 725 plant accessions have been duplicated there through two shipments made in May and December 2024. “On February 26, the SGSV doors were opened for the first time in 2025 to deposit seeds from Malaysia and 20 other countries,” MARDI said.

MARDI further stated that this effort is an important step in ensuring the security and availability of genetic food resources in case the country faces disaster risks that may destroy genetic resource storage facilities in the country.

KUALA LUMPUR, March 3 — Malaysia’s manufacturing sector showed signs of expansion as new orders increased for the first time in four months, suggesting growth momentum into 2025.

The S&P Global Malaysia Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose to 49.7 in February, the highest since August 2024, moving closer to the neutral 50.0 mark.

“February data indicated improving trends for the Malaysian manufacturing sector, although conditions remained generally challenging,” said Usamah Bhatti, economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Manufacturers reported a slight increase in new business, with firms attributing this to a gradual improvement in demand despite lingering caution among clients.

The rise in orders helped soften the decline in production volumes, though employment levels remained slightly reduced.

“Most encouragingly, firms were able to secure greater volumes of new work for the first time in four months; however, there were still reports that demand remained largely muted,” Bhatti added.

While domestic sales improved, export orders continued to decline, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.

Manufacturers maintained a cautious approach, limiting stockpiling and reducing purchasing activity at a slower rate than in January.

“Cost inflation also remained subdued compared to the series average and was little changed from that observed in January,” Bhatti noted.

Looking ahead, firms expressed optimism that the rebound in new orders would persist and accelerate, paving the way for a broader recovery.

“The outlook for the coming months appears brighter, as firms are hopeful that the renewed increase in new orders will be sustained and accelerate, leading to an eventual recovery in production levels,” Bhatti said.",1.74105E+12,en,0.768578053,2025-03-03 01:17:00,"['four', 'time', 'optimism', 'bump', 'average', 'sector', 'indicated', 'slight', 'work', 'outlook', 'particularly', 'way', 'export', 'employment', 'usamah', 'condition', 'market', 'bhatti', 'recovery', 'firm', 'lumpur', 'renewed', 'index', 'month', 'domestic', 'paving', 'series', 'coming', 'january', 'highest', 'muted', 'appears', 'added', 'malaysian', 'advertisement', 'cautious', 'though', 'increase', 'persist', 'attributing', 'moving', 'generally', 'also', 'since', 'suggesting', 'improvement', 'remained', 'production', 'greater', 'inflation', 'trend', 'oct', 'business', 'although', 'caution', 'latest', 'momentum', 'rise', 'asiapacific', 'increased', 'expansion', 'changed', 'slower', 'improving', 'volume', 'limiting', 'secure', 'mark', 'eventual', 'reduced', 'see', 'august', 'helped', 'however', 'subdued', 'improved', 'sign', 'among', 'looking', 'accelerate', 'decline', 'maintained', 'observed', 'noted', 'region', 'demand', 'cost', 'sustained', 'little', 'leading', 'manager', 'global', 'manufacturing', 'hopeful', 'first', 'manufacturer', 'soften', 'economist', 'lingering', 'rose', 'activity', 'order', 'able', 'closer', 'despite', 'reported', 'stockpiling', 'report', 'ahead', 'approach', 'growth', 'pmi', 'slightly', 'intelligence', 'would', 'compared', 'encouragingly', 'kuala', 'gradual', 'february', 'broader', 'rate', 'rebound', 'largely', 'showed', 'neutral', 'brighter', 'data', 'still', 'challenging', 'sale', 'malaysia', 'said', 'purchasing', 'client', 'level', 'reducing', 'expressed', 'new', 'march', 'continued']",Positive

The Royal Malaysia Police (PDRM) recently revealed that 49,598 summonses have been issued by its Traffic Investigation and Enforcement Department (JSPT) to foreign vehicles in Malaysia from January 2022 to November 2024.

However, out of the number, only 8,593 of the summonses have been paid, with a whopping 41,005 summonses amounting to millions of ringgit yet to be settled.

PDRM issued 49,598 summonses to foreign-registered vehicles since 2022, a majority of them were from Singapore

Harian Metro quoted JSPT Director Datuk Seri Mohd Yusri Hassan Basri as saying that most of the 49,598 summonses were issued to Singapore-registered vehicles.

Specifically, 33,033 summonses were issued to vehicles from Singapore, but only 4,391 of them have been paid. This means that 28,642 summonses issued to Singapore-registered vehicles while in Malaysia have yet to be settled.

Taking the second spot on the list is Thailand, whereby during the same period, 7,725 summonses were issued by PDRM to Thai-registered vehicles, with 6,589 summonses still unpaid.

Meanwhile, Brunei-registered vehicles in Malaysia were issued 5,917 summonses (3,721 unpaid), Indonesia-registered vehicles 772 summonses (585 unpaid) and the remaining 2,151 summonses (1,468 unpaid) were vehicles from other countries.

Mohd Yusri further revealed the offences that the foreign vehicles were responsible for out of the total 49,598 summonses:

In June last year, Transport Minister Anthony Loke Siew Fook reminded Singaporean drivers to clear any summonses they might have before leaving Malaysia.

Meanwhile, in October 2024, the newly enforced Vehicle Entry Permit (VEP) RFID tag was spotted displaying unpaid summonses of Singapore-registered vehicles while they passed through the Malaysia-Singapore border checkpoints.

What’s going on here?

Malaysia's palm oil futures dropped 1.34% on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange, influenced by softer demand during Ramadan and stiff competition from soyoil in the Dalian market.

What does this mean?

This dip in Malaysian palm oil futures underscores the intricate dynamics within global vegetable oil markets, where prices of related oils like soyoil exert direct influences. The decline is partly seasonal, linked to Ramadan, and exacerbated by competitive pricing from China's Dalian Commodity Exchange. Malaysian exports are predicted to fall by up to 11% in February, further pressured by Indonesia lowering its crude palm oil reference price while maintaining its export tax. Despite these challenges, the overall oil market gains support from positive Chinese manufacturing data, with oil prices seeing a 1% rise.

Why should I care?

For markets: Shifting tides in the oil seas.

Investor sentiment around Malaysian palm oil remains cautious as export forecasts soften. Global competition is intensifying, with China's soyoil market playing a pivotal role. Meanwhile, US investors watch potential trade disruptions involving tariffs, adding uncertainty. Monitoring technical support levels, like the 4,473 ringgit per metric ton mark, is crucial for traders in the upcoming weeks.

The bigger picture: Global commodities face a rebalance.

As palm oil grapples with fluctuating demands and competitive pressures, broader economic indicators, including China's manufacturing uptick, provide mixed impacts on global markets. Additionally, geopolitical measures such as US tariffs could reshape commodity trading, emphasizing the delicate interplay between Southeast Asian production hubs and consuming nations globally.",1.74105E+12,en,-0.360853136,2025-03-03 04:49:41,"['crude', 'per', 'direct', 'predicted', 'consuming', 'china', 'bursa', 'bigger', 'including', 'upcoming', 'brief', 'pressured', 'southeast', 'sea', 'export', 'exacerbated', 'around', 'market', 'trade', 'crucial', 'happened', 'ramadan', 'pricing', 'uncertainty', 'going', 'pressure', 'stiff', 'globally', 'face', 'care', 'daily', 'underscore', 'oil', 'within', 'dropped', 'dip', 'malaysian', 'derivative', 'could', 'trader', 'cautious', 'emphasizing', 'geopolitical', 'whats', 'monitoring', 'soyoil', 'picture', 'economic', 'watch', 'exchange', 'production', 'remains', 'shifting', 'mean', 'ringgit', 'potential', 'today', 'chinese', 'rise', 'related', 'meanwhile', 'fluctuating', 'impact', 'partly', 'positive', 'fall', 'free', 'challenge', 'investor', 'role', 'hub', 'seasonal', 'maintaining', 'mark', 'softer', 'competitive', 'provide', 'lowering', 'forecast', 'future', 'reshape', 'metric', 'ton', 'tariff', 'decline', 'trading', 'commodity', 'support', 'nation', 'disruption', 'sentiment', 'demand', 'reference', 'global', 'measure', 'tax', 'manufacturing', 'overall', 'adding', 'price', 'vegetable', 'uptick', 'soften', 'gain', 'dynamic', 'technical', 'playing', 'interplay', 'rebalance', 'influence', 'additionally', 'despite', 'exert', 'week', 'involving', 'tide', 'mixed', 'newsletter', 'asian', 'pivotal', 'february', 'broader', 'find', 'seeing', 'linked', 'intricate', 'grapple', 'competition', 'data', 'indonesia', 'palm', 'malaysia', 'intensifying', 'level', 'indicator', 'dalian', 'delicate', 'influenced', 'like']",Neutral

Pro-Net, the new energy vehicle (NEV) arm of Proton, has announced it has delivered 1,000 units of the eMas 7. This achievement comes a little over two months after the Proton’s first electric vehicle (EV) went on sale last December.

“The success of the eMas 7 is a reflection of our commitment to providing a compelling EV proposition that aligns with the needs of Malaysian consumers. Our goal is not just to sell cars but to foster a complete ecosystem that ensures a seamless and confident transition to electric mobility,” said Zhang Qiang, CEO of Pro-Net.

In an official release, the company said it had secured over 4,500 bookings for the eMas 7. It added that it was confident that the figure will increase to 6,000 bookings soon with the extension of a special launch package that provides exclusive pricing for the first 6,000 customers (previously 3,000).

With the promo, the base Prime variant retails for RM105,800 (instead of RM109,800), while the top-spec Premium can be had RM119,800 (instead of RM123,800) – these are on-the-road prices excluding insurance.

The eMas 7 was the best-selling EV in Malaysia in January this year, with 421 units registered according to data from the road transport department (JPJ). The company also noted the eMas 7 currently commands a 25% share of the local EV market.

VIENTIANE – Stronger alignment between sub-regional initiatives and ASEAN’s broader strategic vision is needed, envisaging that closer cooperation will enhance trade, infrastructure, digital transformation, and environmental sustainability.

This was the key message delivered by Laos’ Minister of Foreign Affairs Thongsavanh Phomvihane when addressing the Plenary Session III titled

“ASEAN Subregional Cooperation for Resilience and Sustainability” at the second ASEAN Future Forum in Hanoi on Wednesday.

In his address, Mr Thongsavanh underscored the vital role of subregional cooperation in driving economic integration, closing development gaps, and ensuring ASEAN’s collective resilience in an increasingly complex world and rapid global transformation.

He highlighted that ASEAN’s success hinges on its ability to create a balanced and inclusive growth model, where no member state is left behind.

With geopolitical tensions, climate change, and economic disruptions reshaping the global landscape, ASEAN should act decisively to strengthen its foundations and future-proof the region.

ASEAN’s subregional cooperation frameworks have been instrumental in fostering economic and social progress while addressing region-specific challenges.

Minister Thongsavanh noted that these mechanisms serve as crucial building blocks for ASEAN’s regional integration and long-term sustainability.

In addition, he highlighted several key initiatives including the Mekong Subregional Cooperation Frameworks, the Brunei Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area, and the Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle.

These initiatives have not only boosted economic activity within their respective regions but have also strengthened ASEAN-wide integration, ensuring that prosperity is shared equitably among all member states.

Mr Thongsavanh placed particular emphasis on the Mekong subregion, a region that has become a hub for international cooperation and economic collaboration.

He highlighted the impact of the Mekong River Commission (MRC), the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Initiative, Mekong-Lancang, Mekong-Japan, Mekong-US, and Mekong-Australia partnerships.

These strategic collaborations have improved infrastructure, expanded trade, boosted job creation, and promoted climate resilience, proving that subregional cooperation is not just a necessity but a powerful tool for sustainable progress.

To ensure that ASEAN leverages the full potential of subregional cooperation, Mr Thongsavanh outlined five strategic priorities in relation to aligning policies for greater synergy by strengthening coordination between subregional and ASEAN-wide frameworks to prevent duplication and maximise impacts.

He also advised enhancing infrastructure and digital connectivity through investment in infrastructure, digital transformation, and cybersecurity to drive seamless economic integration.

Additionally, the bloc will need to foster green and inclusive growth by integrating climate-resilient infrastructure, sustainable energy, and circular economy principles into development strategies.

At the same time, securing investment and financial support will necessitate partnering with international financial institutions, private investors, and development agencies to fund key projects.

Lastly, people-to-people links need to be fostered by expanding education, skills development, and cultural exchanges to deepen regional identity and cooperation.

Mr Thongsavanh reaffirmed Laos’ unwavering commitment to working with ASEAN member states and international partners to enhance subregional cooperation as a pillar of regional resilience.

“ASEAN’s strength lies in its unity and inclusivity. By reinforcing subregional cooperation, we can ensure sustainable growth, foster innovation, and build a future where no one is left behind,” he said.

As ASEAN navigates global economic shifts and environmental challenges, subregional cooperation will be a defining factor in the region’s ability to adapt, compete, and thrive.",1.74105E+12,en,0.643033207,2025-03-03 04:28:34,"['reshaping', 'full', 'minister', 'strengthened', 'time', 'darussalamindonesiamalaysiaphilippines', 'mekonglancang', 'asean', 'seamless', 'rapid', 'sustainability', 'including', 'policy', 'driving', 'cooperation', 'build', 'addition', 'securing', 'inclusive', 'plenary', 'mekong', 'prosperity', 'ensuring', 'foundation', 'tool', 'peopletopeople', 'crucial', 'trade', 'thongsavanh', 'collective', 'unity', 'unwavering', 'social', 'identity', 'brunei', 'alignment', 'collaboration', 'energy', 'enhance', 'act', 'mechanism', 'complex', 'fostered', 'equitably', 'investment', 'vital', 'emphasis', 'foster', 'iii', 'priority', 'message', 'stronger', 'world', 'shared', 'infrastructure', 'change', 'within', 'lastly', 'compete', 'vision', 'transformation', 'inclusivity', 'member', 'powerful', 'placed', 'principle', 'strengthening', 'aligning', 'session', 'regionspecific', 'respective', 'phomvihane', 'serve', 'river', 'international', 'geopolitical', 'promoted', 'progress', 'expanded', 'economic', 'cultural', 'also', 'forum', 'subregion', 'exchange', 'area', 'enhancing', 'become', 'key', 'address', 'leverage', 'greater', 'regional', 'decisively', 'maximise', 'wednesday', 'deepen', 'working', 'pillar', 'highlighted', 'drive', 'lie', 'one', 'potential', 'block', 'balanced', 'state', 'mrc', 'prevent', 'factor', 'creation', 'commitment', 'model', 'impact', 'expanding', 'strength', 'vientiane', 'subregional', 'indonesiamalaysiathailand', 'navigates', 'framework', 'challenge', 'partnership', 'investor', 'advised', 'role', 'hub', 'green', 'commission', 'addressing', 'fund', 'future', 'closing', 'private', 'tension', 'improved', 'landscape', 'among', 'agency', 'financial', 'noted', 'development', 'support', 'disruption', 'education', 'region', 'boosted', 'resilience', 'environmental', 'job', 'thrive', 'proving', 'global', 'building', 'fostering', 'need', 'circular', 'climateresilient', 'defining', 'create', 'necessity', 'reaffirmed', 'strengthen', 'ability', 'triangle', 'aseanwide', 'envisaging', 'integration', 'ensure', 'innovation', 'activity', 'synergy', 'digital', 'affair', 'closer', 'additionally', 'success', 'needed', 'climate', 'strategy', 'five', 'growth', 'longterm', 'mekongjapan', 'integrating', 'adapt', 'necessitate', 'delivered', 'institution', 'east', 'partner', 'second', 'futureproof', 'mekongaustralia', 'outlined', 'economy', 'particular', 'relation', 'broader', 'connectivity', 'hanoi', 'link', 'behind', 'bloc', 'duplication', 'foreign', 'strategic', 'skill', 'lao', 'initiative', 'reinforcing', 'gap', 'several', 'partnering', 'mekongus', 'cybersecurity', 'project', 'titled', 'increasingly', 'said', 'instrumental', 'left', 'sustainable', 'shift', 'hinge', 'march', 'underscored', 'coordination']",Positive

In the first quarter of 2020, Brent crude tumbled over 65% from its year-start levels, as global demand evaporated under lockdowns; by 2023, however, it had averaged US$83 (RM364.12) per barrel, down from US$101 in 2022 and roughly US$81 in 2024. US President Donald Trump’s “America First” energy agenda — unleashing a US shale surge, imposing tariffs on Chinese goods, and withdrawing from the Paris climate pact — amplified these supply-demand swings and regulatory uncertainty, forcing Malaysia to weather thinner trade surpluses, ringgit gyrations, and a bruised fiscal cushion.

Rethinking fuel subsidies

By June 2024, Putrajaya had ripped up blanket diesel subsidies in Peninsular Malaysia, sending pump prices from RM2.15 to RM3.35 per litre — yet instead of leaving smallholders and truckers stranded, the government funnelled RM200 a month under the Budi Madani programme to vulnerable diesel-dependent groups.

Simultaneously, it retooled RON95 petrol aid to protect the bottom 85% of earners while phasing out support for the top 15%. In doing so, Malaysia transformed subsidy reform from a political liability into a fiscal advantage.

Doubling down on the green transition

Recognising that volatility won’t abate, Malaysia has accelerated its pivot to renewables. The Green Technology Master Plan targets 40% renewable energy in the power mix by 2035 through solar, hydroelectric, and waste-to-energy projects. April 2024 saw the launch of Energy Exchange Malaysia (Enegem), a 100MW pilot auction exporting green power to Singapore and laying the foundation for an integrated Asean grid. The 2023 National Energy Transition Roadmap commits to 70% renewable capacity by 2050, while the 2024 Aviation Decarbonisation Blueprint and the 2023-2040 Circular Economy Roadmap set ambitious net-zero and resource-efficiency milestones across transport and industry.

Hydrocarbons: Still an economic heavyweight

Despite the green rush, oil and gas remain pillars of the economy — making up roughly 7% of gross domestic product (about RM124 billion in 2022), 15% of exports, and 20% to 30% of federal revenue, buoyed by Petronas’ RM375 billion haul that year. Natural gas alone contributed RM52 billion in 2024, powering factories and turbines nationwide. Paradoxically, Malaysia still imports more refined products than it exports — an inefficiency the government plans to remedy through expanded downstream capacity at Pengerang.

Chinese juggernaut and the Malacca Dilemma

To our north and east, the Chinese energy juggernaut looms larger by the day. In 2023, it consumed 16.4 million barrels per day of liquid fuels — more than triple India’s demand — and imported 11.3 million barrels per day of crude for its refineries and petrochemical complexes. Yet nearly 80% of those imports must pass through the narrow Strait of Malacca — a vulnerability Admiral Hu Jintao dubbed the “Malacca Dilemma” in 2003. While Beijing has built pipelines through Myanmar and Central Asia to bypass the choke point, most of its oil still flows past our shores, intertwining Malaysia’s economic fortunes with every Sino-American flare-up and Indian Ocean security calculus.

Charting a new course: Diversification and resilience

That interdependence can be a vulnerability — or an opportunity.

Speaking in Parliament on Monday, he said the government inherited a high debt burden of RM1 trillion at the end of 2022, which has since risen to RM1.2 trillion or over 64% of GDP. He stressed that the government has never borrowed to finance operating expenditure but has done so to support development projects.

“With a history of fiscal deficits since 1998, we have consistently taken steps to reduce the deficit gradually from 5.5% in 2022 to 5% in 2023 and now 4.1% in 2024, lower than the initial target of 4.3%,” he said.

The government plans to further trim borrowing, with new debt issuance expected to decline from RM100 billion in 2022 to RM77 billion in 2024. The aim is to bring the debt-to-GDP ratio below 60% and meet the Fiscal Responsibility Act’s (FRA) medium-term target of a 3% fiscal deficit by 2028.

For Budget 2025, development spending will be reduced to RM86 billion in line with the lower deficit, but additional investments through public-private partnerships (PFI) worth RM9 billion and RM25 billion in domestic direct investments from government-linked investment companies (GLICs) will push total public investment to RM120 billion.

These measures, Amir Hamzah said, will sustain economic growth while keeping debt levels manageable.

In Penang, the Queen Street bazaar in Little India was abuzz with activity. Muslims and non- Muslims alike checked out the 25 stalls selling traditional treats such as murtabak and nasi briyani.

Despite the heat and the fasting hours, both traders and customers remained cheerful, embodying the spirit of Ramadan.

Penang Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow, who launched the newly rebranded Ramadan Food Fest 2025, noted the bazaar’s longstanding tradition.

“The Queen Street Ramadan bazaar, organised for about 21 years, is a focal point for the Muslim community seeking food for breaking fast,” he said.

Considering its vibrancy, Chow said there are plans to include all state Ramadan bazaars in the tourism calendar next year as potential tourism products.

He said the Ramadan Food Fest 2025 is more than just a typical bazaar, as it preserves the community’s identity in Penang.

Chow toured the stalls during a 30-minute walkabout, engaging with vendors and visitors.

Meanwhile, other Ramadan bazaars across Malaysia continue to attract crowds eager to buy a variety of dishes for iftar.

In Kuala Lumpur, the Kampung Baru Ramadan bazaar remains a popular destination.

“This is my first time here and it’s very big and clean, and the prices are reasonable,” a visitor, who only wished to be known as Damia, 26, told Bernama.

In Selangor, people flocked to the Stadium Shah Alam Ramadan bazaar as early as 3pm, despite it officially opening at 4pm.

The relocation from its former site has not deterred visitors eager to shop for food and drinks.

At Putrajaya’s Presint 3 Rama­dan bazaar, the 290 stalls saw a lively crowd from 4pm onwards with many visitors bringing reusable bags, showing increased environmental awareness.

In Kedah, people took the oppor­tunity to visit the bazaar as the first few days of Ramadan have been declared a public holiday in the state.

A check at the Simpang Empat Ramadan bazaar near Alor Star showed visitors trickling in as early as 4pm to explore and buy a variety of foods and drinks.

Despite light rain in Johor Baru, people visited the Bandar Baru Uda bazaar for local treats like murtabak and roti john.

In Terengganu, food prices rose slightly due to increased raw material costs, with whole chicken and ikan percik seeing price increases.

In neighbouring Kelantan, vendor Karimah Yusoff, 51, who operates at the Taman Bendahara bazaar, said she sells almost 20 types of drinks at RM4 each.

“Despite a slight increase in ingre­dient prices, our selling pri­ces remain unchanged,” Karimah said, emphasising the commitment to affordability for her customers.

In Sarawak, the bustling Satok Ramadan bazaar remained a top choice among visitors.

“Even with food prices up by RM1 to RM2, people are excited to buy our traditional pastries,” said a vendor.

In Sabah, the Tawau Bataras Ramadan bazaar was packed with locals seeking their favourite dishes such as green banana porridge and nasi kuning berlauk.",1.74105E+12,en,0.644023478,2025-03-03 06:32:14,"['minister', 'time', 'clean', 'across', 'early', 'slight', 'queen', 'almost', 'toured', 'iftar', 'onwards', 'choice', 'excited', 'crowd', 'treat', 'uda', 'whole', 'meal', 'india', 'wished', 'presint', 'reusable', 'continue', 'light', 'vendor', 'kampung', 'newly', 'unchanged', 'include', 'sell', 'banana', 'ramadan', 'explore', 'bag', 'identity', 'walkabout', 'popular', 'damia', 'holiday', 'george', 'porridge', 'rebranded', 'putrajaya', 'town', 'plan', 'considering', 'cheerful', 'simpang', 'lumpur', 'food', 'tradition', 'material', 'tawau', 'year', 'percik', 'stadium', 'type', 'neighbouring', 'roti', 'berlauk', 'spirit', 'trader', 'like', 'increase', 'opportunity', 'briyani', 'attract', 'deterred', 'bataras', 'street', 'affordability', 'muslim', 'visitor', 'vibrancy', 'buy', 'embodying', 'remained', 'non', 'bendahara', 'remains', 'longstanding', 'bringing', 'reasonable', 'fasting', 'seeking', 'showing', 'launched', 'potential', 'emphasising', 'pastry', 'karimah', 'state', 'saw', 'commitment', 'engaging', 'meanwhile', 'trickling', 'operates', 'sarawak', 'near', 'flocked', 'increased', 'yeow', 'customer', 'checked', 'selangor', 'selling', 'calendar', 'visited', 'green', 'kedah', 'eager', 'ingredient', 'empat', 'visit', 'kon', 'organised', 'raw', 'product', 'penang', 'fest', 'point', 'chicken', 'ikan', 'kelantan', 'known', 'yusoff', 'among', 'big', 'noted', 'packed', 'traditional', 'alike', 'relocation', 'cost', 'environmental', 'little', 'star', 'bernama', 'preserve', 'first', 'nasi', 'price', 'drink', 'taman', 'declared', 'chow', 'rose', 'activity', 'bandar', 'people', 'alam', 'stall', 'despite', 'tourism', 'minute', 'fast', 'slightly', 'community', 'former', 'rain', 'murtabak', 'remain', 'terengganu', 'breaking', 'bustling', 'site', 'awareness', 'public', 'kuala', 'shah', 'dish', 'hour', 'check', 'bazaar', 'variety', 'day', 'took', 'alor', 'shop', 'showed', 'next', 'seeing', 'local', 'satok', 'abuzz', 'top', 'sabah', 'baru', 'chief', 'due', 'heat', 'officially', 'favourite', 'malaysia', 'said', 'many', 'opening', 'even', 'johor', 'john', 'focal', 'lively', 'destination', 'told', 'kuning', 'typical']",Positive

Recently, a man from Poland expressed his disappointment after returning home, only to realise that one of his favourite Malaysian dishes, roti canai, was nowhere to be found.

Missing the Malaysian sunshine & roti canai

Pawel Manty, a Polish traveller, had just returned from a 35-day holiday in Malaysia when he shared his thoughts in a Facebook comment.

This amusing exchange was shared by the Meanwhile in Malaysia Facebook page, which posted a screenshot of Pawel’s comment.

According to him, the transition from Malaysia’s bright and sunny weather to Poland’s cold and rainy evenings was already tough—but what made it worse was the fact that roti canai simply didn’t exist in his home country.

Just left sunny Malaysia two days ago after a 35-day vacation. Now I already miss it. Here in Poland, at 8.31pm, it’s just cold rain, and it gets dark after 5pm,” he wrote.

No roti canai in Poland? That’s a letdown

While Malaysians might take roti canai for granted, Pawel was shocked to realise that he couldn’t find the crispy, fluffy flatbread anywhere in Poland.

His craving for the popular dish left him feeling even more nostalgic about his time in Malaysia.

He’s already planning his return

Despite his disappointment, Pawel isn’t letting it get him down for too long.

He reassured that he would be making a trip back next year—not just for the warm weather, but also to satisfy his roti canai cravings once again.

Well, Pawel, if you’re ever back in Malaysia, we’re sure there’ll be plenty of roti canai waiting for you!

The caller ID and scam prevention app said in a media release that the data, collected from January to December 2024, covered eight countries: Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, Brazil, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and the Philippines.

Fraudulent SMS messages also saw a rise, increasing by 19.97% to 5.29 million in 2024 from 4.41 million the previous year.

Further findings indicate that Malaysia had the highest rate of personal data leaks among the countries studied, with 72.5% of users who checked Whoscall’s ID Security feature discovering that their information had been compromised.

Taiwan ranked second with a data leak rate of 62.4%, followed by Japan at 56.7%.

It also found that phone numbers are the most commonly leaked personal data among Malaysians.

""While phone numbers were the most leaked data across all countries (98% in Malaysia) among users, Malaysia stands out for its high rate of name leaks (89%), followed by addresses and emails,"" says Voon Chang Liew, business development director for Gogolook Malaysia, the parent company of Whoscall.

""This makes impersonation scams more convincing, as scammers exploit leaked names to pose as banks, government agencies or delivery services.

""With personal details readily available, scammers can launch highly targeted fraud attempts,"" he says.

According to Commercial Crime Investigation Department (CCID) director, Datuk Seri Ramli Mohamed Yoosuf, the country saw financial losses from scams surge to RM1.57bil in 2024, rising from RM1.22bil the previous year.

""AI (artificial intelligence)-driven scams, including deepfake videos of celebrities and politicians, are making it easier to deceive victims into fraudulent investments or phishing traps. These scams are becoming harder to detect, especially for the elderly, who are often targeted due to their financial savings.

""To combat this, PDRM (Royal Malaysia Police) continues its strategic partnership with Whoscall by sharing PDRM verified scam numbers in Whoscall application, recognising AI-powered solutions as a critical first line of defence.

Minister Amran revealed that Kuala Lumpur had sought to import rice from Indonesia to address a supply shortage that has led to price increases in Malaysia.

“It was interesting, [Malaysia] asked earlier whether [they] could import rice from Indonesia,” he stated during a press conference in Jakarta on Tuesday, following a meeting with Malaysian Agriculture and Food Security Minister Mohamad Bin Sabu, as reported by Bisnis.

“I said, for the time being, we will maintain the [domestic] stocks. We will assess the climate [conditions first],” he explained.

The Indonesian government’s current rice reserve stocks (CBP) held by the State Logistics Agency (Bulog) stand at 3.3 million tonnes, according to the minister. He added that the government aims to increase this to 4 million tonnes by May.

Minister Amran noted that Malaysia is currently facing a rice shortage, only able to meet approximately 40 to 50 per cent of its national demand, which has driven up prices in the country.

Malaysian Minister Mohamad Bin Sabu acknowledged that there was no official directive yet to import rice from Indonesia but indicated that the ministry would further discuss the possibility.

“Not yet, but we will discuss,” he said at the same event, as reported by Bisnis. He also conveyed Malaysia’s intention to collaborate with Indonesia on enhancing its domestic rice production through agricultural technology exchange and training programs.

Looking ahead, Minister Amran mentioned that Japan’s Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is scheduled to visit Indonesia on April 29 to discuss potential rice supplies.

Japan itself is experiencing a significant surge in rice prices, which have climbed to between IDR93,000 (USD5.52) and IDR100,000 per kilogram, the Indonesian minister noted.

According to local media The Mainichi, rice prices in Japan have been on an upward trend for 15 consecutive weeks, despite government efforts to stabilise the market by releasing stockpiled supplies. The Mainichi reported on Tuesday that the average price for 5 kilograms of rice reached JPY4,217 (USD29.72) between April 7 and 13, the highest since tracking began in March 2022 and a significant increase of JPY2,139 compared to the same period last year.

Based on Statistics Indonesia’s (BPS) February Area Sample Framework Survey (KSA), Indonesia’s total rice production for the January-May period is estimated to reach 34.47 million tonnes of unhusked rice (GKP).

Indonesian Political Economy Association (AEPI) agriculture expert Khudori, as reported by Bisnis, estimates that this unhusked rice production will yield approximately 16.62 million tonnes of rice for public consumption during the same period. This represents an increase of 1.83 million tonnes, or 12.4 per cent, compared to the same period last year.

Last year, Indonesia’s annual rice production for public food consumption totaled around 30.62 million tonnes, according to the BPS, marking a 1.54 per cent decrease compared to the 31.1 million tonnes produced in 2023.",1.74559E+12,en,-0.096516691,2025-04-24 07:45:42,"['per', 'minister', 'time', 'following', 'annjakarta', 'meeting', 'indonesian', 'average', 'aepi', 'supply', 'indicated', 'fishery', 'consumption', 'totaled', 'usd', 'forestry', 'period', 'import', 'interesting', 'program', 'sought', 'andi', 'stand', 'yield', 'around', 'yet', 'condition', 'market', 'security', 'cent', 'directive', 'agriculture', 'acknowledged', 'collaborate', 'conference', 'cbp', 'sufficient', 'intention', 'tonne', 'conveyed', 'mohamad', 'lumpur', 'logistics', 'facing', 'domestic', 'food', 'last', 'represents', 'highest', 'request', 'year', 'sabu', 'political', 'estimate', 'annual', 'driven', 'added', 'may', 'khudori', 'decrease', 'current', 'held', 'malaysian', 'began', 'could', 'event', 'increase', 'rice', 'ksa', 'also', 'exchange', 'since', 'based', 'enhancing', 'official', 'area', 'address', 'sulaiman', 'bulog', 'production', 'surge', 'amran', 'januarymay', 'trend', 'experiencing', 'potential', 'medium', 'reached', 'state', 'explained', 'ministry', 'sample', 'earlier', 'association', 'estimated', 'revealed', 'significant', 'rejected', 'produced', 'upward', 'technology', 'framework', 'led', 'maintain', 'possibility', 'stock', 'releasing', 'visit', 'climbed', 'citing', 'looking', 'agency', 'bps', 'idr', 'mainichi', 'tuesday', 'noted', 'japan', 'effort', 'jpy', 'demand', 'survey', 'bisnis', 'million', 'tracking', 'first', 'need', 'price', 'country', 'jakarta', 'stockpiled', 'gkp', 'able', 'agricultural', 'despite', 'reported', 'asked', 'climate', 'week', 'approximately', 'national', 'ahead', 'stated', 'would', 'total', 'meet', 'expert', 'according', 'stabilise', 'compared', 'kilogram', 'public', 'aim', 'kuala', 'government', 'scheduled', 'economy', 'february', 'shortage', 'local', 'assess', 'mentioned', 'marking', 'whether', 'reach', 'indonesia', 'april', 'malaysia', 'said', 'training', 'post', 'currently', 'bin', 'discus', 'unhusked', 'consecutive', 'statistic', 'reserve', 'march', 'press']",Neutral

Shanmugam said Monday.

The probe follows reports of arrests linked to the alleged procurement and shipment of these chips in violation of U.S. sanctions.

Authorities suspect that individuals misled server suppliers about the actual end-users of the hardware, which was shipped from Singapore to Malaysia. Investigators are now determining whether these servers were further exported to other restricted countries.

Singapore has requested additional information from Malaysia and the U.S. to track the final destination.

Preliminary findings indicate that the servers may contain Nvidia chips, potentially subjecting them to U.S. export restrictions. However, Shanmugam refrained from confirming their presence, emphasizing that the case is an independent fraud probe based on an anonymous tip rather than a direct U.S. request.

The case highlights Singapore-based entities’ role in channeling high-end semiconductors to China and other restricted regions. It also comes as the U.S. tightens global chip export curbs, with the Trump administration reviewing further restrictions.

U.S. officials are separately investigating whether Chinese AI startup DeepSeek acquired Nvidia chips through third-party suppliers in Singapore.

Agriculture and Food Security Ministry secretary-general Datuk Seri Isham Ishak said by focusing on slow food, local sourcing, and climate-smart farming, Malaysia is not only protecting its heritage but also future-proofing food systems.

“This reaffirms our commitment to the National Agrofood Policy 2.0 – a comprehensive policy built to modernise Malaysia’s agrofood sector and secure our food resilience for generations.

“The agrofood sector contributes not just to GDP but to the daily well-being of every Malaysian household,“ he said at the International Café and Beverage Show 2025 (ICBS 2025) and MyFood 2025 today.

Isham pointed out that the National Agrofood Policy 2.0 lays out a bold vision, which is to transform Malaysia’s agrofood system into one that is resilient, sustainable, technologically advanced, and inclusive.

Five strategic thrusts support this transformation – modernisation and smart agriculture, market and product development, human capital empowerment, sustainable and resilient food systems, and conducive business environment and governance.

“For 2025, we are prioritising the reformation of the paddy and rice industry, including upgrading paddy fields and restructuring the value chain.

“Our aim is to improve productivity, raise farmers’ income, and ensure a rice supply chain that can weather global volatility and climate threats. We are also working to boost the productivity of the ruminant subsector and attract greater private sector participation in high-value areas such as aquaculture, floriculture and fruits.

“A thriving local agriculture base is the foundation of export readiness. As we strengthen domestic production, we are naturally better positioned to tap into export markets – especially with premium products like durian, edible bird’s nest, and ornamental fish, which already enjoy global demand,“ Isham said.

He noted that the Agriculture and Food Security Ministry’s export facilitation initiatives have yielded remarkable outcomes.

He pointed out that in 2021, 296 Malaysian companies and 335 stock-keeping units (SKUs) were successfully introduced to international markets through various food expos around the globe.

“By 2024, these figures had soared to 2,704 companies and 3,838 SKUs, an impressive leap that reflects the rising global recognition of Malaysian agrofood excellence. In the years to come, I am confident that we will witness an upsurge in these figures as more of our local food producers penetrate the global market,“ he said.

As Malaysia pushes toward a more competitive agrofood industry, quality and trust become the nation’s strongest differentiators, Isham said.

“That is why we continue to champion ‘Malaysia’s Best’, a commitment to quality assurance and sustainable practices across the agrofood supply chain. From MyGAP to MyOrganic, and from Fama’s Good Practice Labelling to globally accepted traceability systems, our certifications are not only benchmarks of safety and integrity but also symbols of Malaysian excellence.”

Isham said through platforms such as MyFood, Malaysia can forge powerful collaborations between government, industry, academia, NGOs and agropreneurs and co-create solutions that are scalable, inclusive and future-focused.

“More than just a domestic showcase, an event like MyFood has also emerged as a catalyst in elevating Malaysia’s agrofood identity on the global stage. By highlighting high-quality, value-added products, it opens up international markets for our local producers and enhances Malaysia’s reputation as a reliable source of premium agro-based goods,“ he added.",1.74559E+12,en,0.645807147,2025-04-24 11:40:00,"['stage', 'café', 'spearhead', 'asean', 'agrofood', 'sector', 'supply', 'across', 'forge', 'upsurge', 'generation', 'including', 'policy', 'stockkeeping', 'bold', 'comprehensive', 'champion', 'pointed', 'secretarygeneral', 'household', 'inclusive', 'export', 'prioritising', 'continue', 'futurefocused', 'foundation', 'protecting', 'around', 'successfully', 'market', 'reformation', 'security', 'seri', 'impressive', 'penetrate', 'witness', 'trust', 'identity', 'agriculture', 'readiness', 'valueadded', 'highlighting', 'restructuring', 'globally', 'chain', 'recognition', 'confident', 'integrity', 'collaboration', 'showcase', 'lumpur', 'durian', 'icbs', 'already', 'domestic', 'food', 'cocreate', 'chair', 'thriving', 'certification', 'source', 'nest', 'daily', 'year', 'boost', 'differentiator', 'conducive', 'vision', 'transformation', 'technologically', 'value', 'tap', 'highquality', 'added', 'powerful', 'malaysian', 'weather', 'event', 'come', 'participation', 'catalyst', 'international', 'skus', 'slow', 'volatility', 'attract', 'heritage', 'show', 'transform', 'rice', 'paddy', 'also', 'introduced', 'area', 'good', 'improve', 'become', 'soared', 'farming', 'production', 'greater', 'regional', 'ornamental', 'fruit', 'push', 'especially', 'strategically', 'working', 'business', 'facilitation', 'upgrading', 'one', 'today', 'ministry', 'fish', 'strongest', 'rising', 'commitment', 'datuk', 'agropreneurs', 'threat', 'edible', 'scalable', 'globe', 'traceability', 'productivity', 'aquaculture', 'leap', 'open', 'safety', 'assurance', 'myfood', 'farmer', 'platform', 'secure', 'beverage', 'agrobased', 'excellence', 'remarkable', 'competitive', 'advanced', 'premium', 'naturally', 'private', 'thrust', 'yielded', 'modernisation', 'smart', 'product', 'modernise', 'sourcing', 'resilient', 'income', 'base', 'gdp', 'unit', 'reaffirms', 'raise', 'support', 'noted', 'development', 'benchmark', 'nation', 'reliable', 'figure', 'demand', 'resilience', 'positioned', 'capital', 'global', 'climatesmart', 'empowerment', 'labelling', 'isham', 'strengthen', 'ensure', 'highvalue', 'bird', 'toward', 'every', 'reputation', 'best', 'subsector', 'academia', 'expo', 'climate', 'ngo', 'national', 'field', 'company', 'famas', 'five', 'futureproofing', 'ishak', 'mygap', 'human', 'built', 'solution', 'elevating', 'system', 'aim', 'kuala', 'floriculture', 'government', 'ruminant', 'practice', 'environment', 'strategic', 'outcome', 'contributes', 'enjoy', 'local', 'symbol', 'initiative', 'lay', 'focusing', 'reflects', 'industry', 'various', 'malaysia', 'producer', 'said', 'governance', 'quality', 'sustainable', 'myorganic', 'accepted', 'emerged', 'enhances', 'better', 'wellbeing', 'like']",Positive

When you eventually do leave Sunway University, you ultimately leave as a leader.” — Chai

For many students around the world, the higher education experience tends to hold many similarities. While the places and the courses may differ, many higher education institutions do tend to subscribe to similar methods and schools of thought.

However, Sunway University aims to redefine this experience with its newly developed Sunway Signature Collection — “an educational journey like no other”, according to pro vice-chancellor Professor Chai Lay Ching.

“We call it student experience reengineering. So the whole focus is on creating programmes and ecosystems that truly support students. Not just to learn knowledge and skills that are required within their programme, but also to acquire values and mindsets such as sustainable development, planetary health and entrepreneurship,” she explains.

Essentially, Chai says, the carefully curated Sunway Signature Collection student experience is the organisation’s answer to the disconnect that currently exists between the academic framework of learning, and the skills and knowledge that is needed by the student to be a productive, contributing member of society.

This transformation is driven by four strategic pillars: namely personalised pathways for every ambition; industry as a classroom; global excellence, local impact; and future-proofing through sustainability and innovation.

According to Chai, the journey starts from day one. “The first day when the students enrol in their study programme, they are guided through a structured process that helps them to envision the future career that they actually want to engage in.

“Rather than entering university not knowing their direction, we equip them with the skills that are actually required in the current day, and this will prepare them to be the future leaders that can shape the industry when they graduate.”

This, she explains, is what Sunway University classifies as a Career Xcellerator Pathway, an even mix of a more classic educational experience, but with a modern slant that helps students go beyond book learning, integrating career-focused and industry-driven content to better prepare students for the real world.

However, Chai points out that career paths are not as clear-cut as they used to be, and that is where the Career FleX Pathway comes in. This allows students to blend multidisciplinary courses, which would allow them to curate their own idea of what a dream job looks like.

“For example, maybe a student wants to be a KOL (key opinion leader) after they graduate. Or maybe I am taking biotech, but I want to be able to communicate about science on a public platform. Can they go into that? The answer is yes, we have designed the pedagogy in a way that it provides them that flexibility, so it empowers them to design their career path,” Chai says.

She points out that Sunway Signature Collection is not just mere programme collecting, that it is all about making it a r icher academic experience for students. Another big aspect of the Sunway Signature Collection is that you don’t have to experience it alone.

“Each of our students, when they first join the university, they will be appointed a success coach. This is part of our Success X-Factor Coaching Model that we actually provide for our students, where these coaches will provide them with guidance in their study and future career preparation. When students face challenges, when they face problems, these coaches are the first people that they can approach for advice.”

This is kicked up a notch in their final year where the students not only get an additional success coach, but that coach will either be a director or leader of the industry of that particular discipline.

“These will all be people from the C-suites, those will be the sort of individuals that Sunway University will engage. As you know, the Sunway Group is a conglomerate, and that means that we have a wide range of resources at our disposal. For example, let’s say a student wants to go into marketing, we can get marketing directors to become coaches.

“What this ultimately does is that it opens up avenues for them to eventually land a job and start their career,” says Chai.

Chai says the carefully curated Sunway Signature Collection student experience is the organisation’s answer to the disconnect that currently exists between the academic framework of learning, and the skills and knowledge that is needed by the student to be a productive, contributing member of society

Making the world your classroom

In a world where borders are fast dissolving, it only makes sense that in modern education, students are not confined by the physical walls of their classroom. Sunway University is well-known for ensuring that its students are exposed to real-world scenarios so as to prepare them when they go out into the world.

All the programmes integrate industry-driven learning, which translates into incorporating live projects and case studies into the curriculum. This is alongside a series of guest lectures by industry leaders, CEOs and innovators who share their invaluable insights.

It is also why every student will have the opportunity to embark on a hands-on industry experience that spans two to almost four months. This could take the form of traditional industry attachments or internships, freelance industry projects or entrepreneurship.

The interesting thing to note is that, as the private education space gets more competitive, other private universities are also starting to do the same. Chai, however, explains that it goes beyond just putting the courses together; rather, it is about weaving it in so that it feels native in the design of the curriculum.

“So that the students also better understand how their future might look like, or what they need to do more in order to achieve that. It gives them some time to say to themselves that they have three years in university to prepare themselves. The backdrop to this is that Sunway University has put in the pedagogy that will help you excel and thrive.”

She acknowledges that Sunway University, while accomplished, is still a fairly young educational institution compared with its peers. It is also no secret that the university has spent a considerable amount of time building up not just partnerships, but the right partnerships.

“It is a global campus that we are creating over here in Sunway University, but what does it actually mean when we say global experience? That is where we carefully design and select our global education partners.”

One of those partners, Lancaster University, has proven to be valuable for Sunway University’s students, with Chai explaining that it allows for a UK education experience without having to travel halfway around the world, or for those who maybe want to go to the UK after they graduate.

Alongside strategic research partnerships with Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Cambridge University, Sunway University also has a relationship with France’s Le Cordon Bleu. There is also the Jeffrey Cheah Biomedical Centre that is established at Cambridge University, which serves as a hub for groundbreaking medical research.

There is also Sunway University’s latest partnership stateside, namely with Arizona State University, which she says opens up opportunities for students.

“A lot of people have the American dream. Some may think, can I go to the US to study despite the fact that I don’t have enough funds to be there for four years? Now they can have that American education right here in Malaysia.

So we have created that pipeline, that pathway for students to engage with the rest of the world, by bringing that world to them here right in the campus. This relationship extends to students crossing borders, and having lectures come in. We have global online classrooms where students can learn and engage.

That is what we mean by global experience and local actions,” says Chai.

It also doesn’t stop when the students leave. Sunway University also takes pride in its strong alumni network. Chai says this goes beyond just the Sunway Group’s network of businesses, with international partnerships strengthening the pool and expanding the professional network, connecting the dots for students.

“Once a Sunwayian, always a Sunwayian,” she says. “It is a family, a network that you will have access to for the rest of your life.”

How to protect the future

It only takes a quick walk through Sunway University to feel the underlying buzz of activity. Teeming with student life, there is always something going on in every corner, the spaces occupied by study groups, the air humming with the sound of collaboration and, sometimes, music.

Sunway University’s campus has always served as a dynamic home for innovation and collaboration. State-of-the-art facilities abound, including AI-enabled labs, co-learning spaces, and over 100 student-led clubs and associations. Students actively participate in hackathons, interdisciplinary projects and leadership roles. This cultivates what used to be deemed as “soft skills” but now have been recognised more as modern life skills such as creativity, teamwork and real world problem-solving.

Chai says this all plays into the final pillar of the Sunway Signature Collection, namely future-proofing through sustainability and innovation.

“We know that AI is coming, so with all the programmes, none of that is factored in. Now we actually design our pedagogy to allow us to integrate the most current emerging technologies into our curriculum. So students learn about AI, sustainable development and planetary health.”

Sunway University bakes this sustainability and ethical leadership pathos right into its core curriculum. Each student will need to complete the modules of Community Service for Planetary Health, Integrity and Sustainable Development, and Entrepreneurial Mindsets and Skills.

“You need to understand, in the entrepreneurial course, for example, it is not about learning how to be a dictionary definition of what an entrepreneur is. It is about learning the skills and mindset in order to be able to identify a problem, take risks and design a solution.

It is the same when it comes to planetary health. Our students actually engage with a community — they help out with the urban poor community that is actually located just 2km away. They go to Desa Mentari to help the community. Again, this teaches them to identify problems related to planetary health, whether it be climate change or crowd control, and, likewise, they come up with solutions.”

Chai says the lessons learnt — empathy and humility — are as valuable as they are non-tangible, underscored by the quiet satisfaction that they actually helped improve the world around them.

“Students can then see that they don’t need to wait for money to come in order to solve a problem. They can see that everything starts from them, and they have been equipped with these skills,” she says.

Lastly, there is the course on integrity andsustainable development. Chai says sustainability as a concept can take many forms. “Sustainability is not just about ensuring that the company, or the project, can get off the ground. Finding funding is just one part of it. But it is also important to be able to handle the stress, the burden that comes with integrity. It is a heavy load to carry on your shoulders. So what Sunway University’s course teaches is how to be able to carry yourself with integrity and in a responsible manner.

“All this makes our students stand out so that when they graduate, they are not just a normal part of the workforce. They are actually the future leaders who will be the ones shaping that industry for the world to see,” she says.

The rest, as they say, is history. Sunway University has seen an enviable rise in the employability of its graduates, from 95% in 2023 to 99.8% in 2024. Many of the alumni have made their mark and risen to leadership roles in top industries. It is no wonder that Sunway University has been named as the top private university in Asean in the AppliedHE Private University Ranking: Asean 2025.

""As Deputy Minister, of course, I prioritize our society. But we also want to contribute to feeding the world,"" said Wamentan when opening the International Fertilizer Producers Event in Bali, quoted by Antara, Friday, April 25.

The Deputy Minister said that Indonesia is not only focused on domestic food security, but is ready to contribute to global food security.

He mentioned that based on data from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) until April 2025, national grain production reached 13.9 million tons. Meanwhile, domestic rice consumption was recorded at around 10.37 million tons, and this shows a surplus and sufficient to meet domestic food needs.

In addition, Deputy Minister Sudaryono or who is familiarly called Mas Dar explained the success of the water supply program through pumping and pipelines that allow farmers to plant two to three times a year.

Through this program, more than 2 million hectares of land were successfully flowed by water, increasing very significant agricultural productivity.

Our planting index has increased. This means that land productivity has also increased. Once planted in a year now it can be two to three times. This is an extraordinary achievement,"" he said.

With this increase in productivity, Indonesia is increasingly optimistic about achieving self-sufficiency in rice. Moreover, Perum Bulog has absorbed 1.4 million tons of unhulled rice from the target of 2 million tons in April 2025. If this target is achieved, Indonesia will no longer need rice imports.

""Bulog Corporation is also asked to maintain rice supply and production amid the crisis experienced by a number of countries such as Japan, the Philippines and Malaysia,"" said Wamenan.

On the other hand, Wementan emphasized the important role of fertilizer in maintaining global food security, especially in the midst of major challenges due to climate change and increasing the world's population.

He stated that fertilizer is not just agricultural input material, but the main element in achieving optimal agricultural products.

Pupuk is the backbone of food security. Without fertilizer, seeds and water alone are not enough to produce optimal production,"" he said.

He also invited all countries and companies to work together to ensure the availability of fertilizer raw materials and encourage innovation of environmentally friendly fertilizer technology.

Indonesia is very open to collaboration with anyone, from any country. Global collaboration is the key to the future of world agriculture,"" he stressed.

Furthermore, Wamenan conveyed the readiness of the Ministry of Agriculture to have a dialogue and open a space for direct cooperation with the participants.

""If there is an issue that you want to convey, I am ready to discuss. Let's make this meeting the beginning of real cooperation for more sustainable world agriculture,"" said Wamenan.

The All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) officially named Australian coach Matt Ross as the new head coach on March 2.

Ross had arrived in Nepal a month earlier amid speculation that he would take over as head coach. However, ANFA only confirmed his appointment after a month.

The position had been vacant since the departure of former head coach Vincenzo Alberto Annese, whose contract expired in May 2024. ANFA did not extend Annese’s tenure or make any immediate decisions about his replacement. In September 2024, ANFA officially announced it would not renew his contract and later invited applications for the head coach position, receiving over 400 applications before selecting Ross.

During the interim period, Nabin Neupane served as Nepal’s caretaker head coach for two friendly matches against Tajikistan and Afghanistan.

First senior men’s team head coach role for Ross

This is Ross’s first appointment as the head coach of a senior men’s national team. Expressing his excitement, Ross shared his short- and long-term objectives with ANFA TV.

“I am very excited to be Nepal’s head coach,” Ross said. He noted that since arriving in Kathmandu, he has closely followed local tournaments such as the Sahapathi Cup, Women’s International Tournament, and KP Oli Cup.

He also mentioned his enthusiasm for Nepal’s upcoming participation in the AFC Asian Cup Qualifiers, saying, “I am eager to see how we perform.”

Targeting points in Malaysia

Ross’s first task as head coach will be Nepal’s friendly match against Singapore, followed by an AFC Asian Cup Qualifier against Malaysia.

Nepal is set to play two matches within three weeks—facing Singapore on March 21 and Malaysia on March 25, both away games.

With limited preparation time, Ross acknowledged the challenge but emphasised the importance of quick adaptation. “Singapore and Malaysia are tough challenges. These first two matches as head coach will be crucial,” he said. “The key is to start training camp early and build relationships with the players.”

Ross highlighted the significance of securing results in these qualifiers. “These two matches are vital. We need to work effectively within the available time to achieve positive outcomes,” he stated.

He further stressed the difficulty of international football but expressed confidence in Nepal’s ability to secure points from Malaysia. “International football is always challenging. Our goal is to return with points from Malaysia,” Ross added.

Long-term goal: Winning the SAFF Championship

Nepal’s senior men’s and women’s teams have yet to win a SAFF Championship title. As with previous coaches, Ross has also set winning the SAFF Championship as a long-term objective.

“In the long term, we aim to develop football in Nepal, including grassroots programs, coach education, and women’s football,” Ross said. “Our ultimate goal is to improve rankings and win the SAFF Championship at both youth and senior levels, for both men’s and women’s teams.”

Ross stated that he is well aware of Nepali football and its players. “I know a lot about Nepali football. Many people are curious about an Australian coach coming in and Nepali players moving abroad,” he said.

He emphasised giving local players opportunities and praised Nepali footballers for their physical and technical strengths. He also lauded the support shown by fans during the recently concluded Women’s International Championship.

“The support for the women’s team was incredible. Fans always provide extra energy and contribute to success. They help take the team to new heights,” Ross remarked.

He called on Nepali supporters to continue backing the team, especially in the upcoming qualifier against Malaysia.

Who is Matt Ross?

Born in Newcastle, England, Australian coach Matt Ross holds a UEFA Pro License. His most recent role was as the assistant coach of South Korea’s women’s national team.

From 2020 to 2023, Ross served as South Korea’s assistant coach, helping the team reach the final of the 2022 AFC Women’s Asian Cup, where they finished as runners-up to China after a 3-2 loss.

Before that, he coached Swedish women’s top-division club Vittsjö GIK and also worked as the head coach of China’s U-15 women’s national team.

Ross initially played amateur football before attempting to become a referee and later a teacher. However, he ultimately pursued a coaching career.

At age 28, he started coaching in Australia but soon moved to Germany, initially to expand his football knowledge. In Germany, he worked as a video analyst before becoming the head coach of the Frankfurt women’s team, leading them to the 2015 UEFA Women’s Champions League title.

After obtaining his UEFA Pro License, Ross spent two years as Frankfurt’s head coach before moving to Sweden in 2017 to coach Vittsjö GIK.

Following a season in Sweden, he accepted a coaching offer from China and later transitioned to South Korea before taking up the Nepal national team role.",1.74105E+12,en,0.599675,2025-03-03 07:15:55,"['receiving', 'preparation', 'time', 'later', 'footballer', 'following', 'newcastle', 'afc', 'extend', 'named', 'knowledge', 'helping', 'early', 'work', 'china', 'head', 'including', 'age', 'period', 'nabin', 'upcoming', 'appointed', 'excited', 'appointment', 'video', 'champion', 'build', 'securing', 'program', 'amateur', 'tough', 'effectively', 'task', 'australia', 'continue', 'sahapathi', 'teacher', 'soon', 'return', 'yet', 'vacancy', 'crucial', 'finished', 'invited', 'alberto', 'develop', 'season', 'served', 'acknowledged', 'speculation', 'decision', 'closely', 'start', 'grassroots', 'energy', 'career', 'limited', 'vital', 'offer', 'month', 'winning', 'oli', 'coming', 'tournament', 'license', 'coached', 'shared', 'year', 'team', 'concluded', 'objective', 'cup', 'within', 'coaching', 'analyst', 'term', 'vittsjö', 'may', 'annese', 'september', 'added', 'curious', 'win', 'height', 'assistant', 'football', 'three', 'topdivision', 'significance', 'taking', 'participation', 'senior', 'international', 'vincenzo', 'opportunity', 'camp', 'swedish', 'quick', 'moving', 'also', 'obtaining', 'since', 'england', 'anneses', 'referee', 'korea', 'men', 'improve', 'nepali', 'key', 'lauded', 'recently', 'contribute', 'immediate', 'played', 'emphasised', 'application', 'become', 'frankfurt', 'final', 'australian', 'extra', 'especially', 'born', 'runnersup', 'highlighted', 'gik', 'association', 'earlier', 'player', 'long', 'know', 'uefa', 'loss', 'transitioned', 'set', 'renew', 'positive', 'remarked', 'called', 'announced', 'strength', 'make', 'hold', 'two', 'challenge', 'nepal', 'replacement', 'well', 'position', 'role', 'weeksfacing', 'matt', 'secure', 'expressing', 'youth', 'provide', 'previous', 'see', 'eager', 'ranking', 'game', 'coach', 'contract', 'however', 'womens', 'relationship', 'afghanistan', 'neupane', 'point', 'friendly', 'play', 'ultimately', 'confidence', 'caretaker', 'interim', 'excitement', 'noted', 'perform', 'achieve', 'support', 'education', 'targeting', 'result', 'title', 'physical', 'leading', 'adaptation', 'first', 'need', 'championship', 'supporter', 'kathmandu', 'abroad', 'short', 'qualifier', 'becoming', 'ultimate', 'amid', 'ability', 'germany', 'sweden', 'confirmed', 'spent', 'technical', 'pro', 'tajikistan', 'people', 'south', 'departure', 'lot', 'success', 'giving', 'club', 'national', 'vacant', 'stated', 'fan', 'longterm', 'help', 'would', 'former', 'saying', 'saff', 'expand', 'started', 'recent', 'attempting', 'ninemonth', 'asian', 'aim', 'tenure', 'always', 'enthusiasm', 'selecting', 'take', 'moved', 'singapore', 'followed', 'away', 'goal', 'aware', 'whose', 'importance', 'outcome', 'local', 'pursued', 'arrived', 'anfa', 'ross', 'mentioned', 'available', 'reach', 'incredible', 'shown', 'officially', 'challenging', 'match', 'arriving', 'malaysia', 'backing', 'said', 'training', 'many', 'level', 'worked', 'expressed', 'league', 'expired', 'accepted', 'new', 'initially', 'difficulty', 'praised', 'march', 'stressed', 'permanent']",Positive

“The question is whether Malaysia was a final destination or from Malaysia, it went to somewhere else, which we do not know for certain at this point,” he told reporters.

“But we assessed that there may have been false representation on the final destination of the servers.”

The chips were embedded in servers supplied by Dell and Supermicro to Singapore-based companies, before they went to Malaysia.

Nvidia’s artificial intelligence chips are subject to US export restrictions. It was recently reported that US authorities are investigating whether Chinese AI sensation DeepSeek had circumvented sanctions through third parties in countries such as Malaysia, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates.

Singapore charged three men with fraud last week in connection with the alleged movement of Nvidia chips, after raids were conducted at 22 locations. They are accused of misleading a supplier of servers on the end-user of the items.

Mr Shanmugam said investigations into the three men were carried out independently by Singapore after authorities received an anonymous tip-off and not requested by the US or any other country.

“There has been some speculation linking this case with the potential circumvention of US export controls for advanced Nvidia chips. Now this case is unrelated. It's an independent investigation conducted by Singapore,” he said.

“Investigations showed potential breaches of our domestic laws, and so we moved quickly to deal with it.”",1.74105E+12,en,-0.473196924,2025-03-03 07:42:00,"['certain', 'minister', 'server', 'deal', 'deepseek', 'monday', 'quickly', 'circumvented', 'circumvention', 'export', 'nvidias', 'representation', 'speculation', 'charged', 'raid', 'arab', 'domestic', 'last', 'else', 'sanction', 'mar', 'chip', 'somewhere', 'may', 'singaporebased', 'question', 'three', 'supermicro', 'anonymous', 'emirate', 'men', 'restriction', 'went', 'recently', 'location', 'final', 'investigating', 'united', 'potential', 'unrelated', 'chinese', 'know', 'alleged', 'tipoff', 'control', 'party', 'false', 'linking', 'third', 'sensation', 'advanced', 'independently', 'independent', 'case', 'point', 'item', 'reporter', 'shanmugam', 'accused', 'sent', 'authority', 'requested', 'law', 'country', 'dell', 'embedded', 'nvidia', 'subject', 'misleading', 'enduser', 'affair', 'reported', 'movement', 'week', 'company', 'intelligence', 'assessed', 'breach', 'conducted', 'carried', 'connection', 'received', 'contained', 'artificial', 'moved', 'singapore', 'showed', 'home', 'investigation', 'linked', 'supplied', 'supplier', 'whether', 'malaysia', 'said', 'fraud', 'destination', 'told']",Neutral

agriculture,Japan to resist Trump efforts to form trade bloc against China — Bloomberg,1.74556E+12,The Edge Malaysia,theedgemalaysia.com,https://news.google.com/read/CBMiUEFVX3lxTE5PTjlYUW1sZlBvMkhLSDFTbVVoaGxUN2hDWGlUX0YxVUppLXVZbUtwdmRCcWhDMU5CMU5BQVZhMlRRZDJqRnNxNk9wYWNTLU1j?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/752958,"(April 25): Japan intends to push back against any US effort to bring it into an economic bloc aligned against China because of the importance of Tokyo’s trade ties with Beijing, according to current and former Japanese government officials.

Like many other countries, Japan is trying to get permanent relief from US President Donald Trump’s tariffs by addressing US concerns in areas of bilateral trade, including automobiles and agriculture. The officials, who asked not to be identified, said that Japan is pushing to strike a deal before the current 90-day reprieve in tariffs expires, with one person saying the country hopes to finalise an agreement around the Group of Seven summit in June.

At the same time, the officials said Japan doesn’t want to get caught up in any US effort to maximise trade pressure on China by curbing its own economic interaction with Beijing, which is Tokyo’s biggest trading partner and an important source of goods and raw materials.

Although the US hasn’t made any specific requests to Japan regarding China, Tokyo would prioritise its own interests if that occurs, Japanese officials said. One of the officials added that Japan has conveyed to China on multiple occasions that it doesn’t fully align with the US on chip-related exports and semiconductor restrictions.

Japan’s Foreign Ministry didn’t immediately provide comment when requested by Bloomberg.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is playing a leading role in trade talks with Japan and other nations, said earlier this month that the US would seek to reach agreements with allies, and “then we can approach China as a group”. Bloomberg subsequently reported that the US is preparing to ask countries seeking tariff relief to reduce economic ties to China, in a move to strengthen US leverage over Beijing, as it tries to win concessions on trade.

Japan’s lead trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa deflected a question about Bessent’s comments on Friday.

“My mission is to request a review of the additional tariffs,” said Akazawa, who is scheduled to return to Washington for a second round of talks with US officials soon.

“The US may try to do something collectively with other nations that also reach a deal with the US. But that will be beyond my responsibilities.”

‘Resolutely opposes’

Japan is now weighing up its concessions ahead of the second round of trade talks.

That could be made in agriculture, with the Yomiuri newspaper saying the government is considering buying more US corn, while the Nikkei said a boost in soybean imports is on the cards. Public broadcaster NHK said the government is looking to present an overview of investments that Japanese carmakers are planning in the US.

Katsunobu Kato, Japan’s finance minister, dampened speculation that the US would make requests over the weak yen, saying that foreign exchange targets had not been discussed during talks on Thursday with Bessent.

As Japan gears up for the trade talks, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is also seeking to cushion the blow that the US tariffs may have on the domestic economy. He announced an emergency economic package that will help smaller businesses and the agriculture industry.

But as Japan works towards closing a deal with the US, Chinese President Xi Jinping’s government has warned countries against striking deals with the US that also target Beijing, saying on Monday it “resolutely opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of China’s interests”.

“We need to be very careful about economic security issues and the supply chain involving China,” Kono Taro, a lawmaker in Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party and former foreign minister, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Wednesday.

Rather than dialling back trade, Tokyo is in the process of trying to get China to resume imports of seafood and beef from Japan after bans imposed over health concerns. A series of Japanese delegations have made trips to China to manage Tokyo’s relationship with Beijing.

On Wednesday, Tetsuo Saito, the leader of the Komeito Party — the junior partner of the ruling coalition — passed a letter from Ishiba for Xi to China’s No 4 official, Wang Huning, during a visit.

Afterward, Saito said that both sides agreed to support the multilateral trading system and independently push the Trump administration to ease tariffs. The ruling party’s secretary general is also set to fly to Beijing on Sunday.

In a sign of Japan Inc’s commitment to the China market, Toyota Motor Corp this week agreed to open a new factory in Shanghai in 2027, with the company reportedly planning to invest around US$2 billion (RM8.76 billion) in the plant.

More pessimistic

Around 20% of Japan’s total commerce is with China, larger than its trade with the US. However, the US overtook China as an export destination for Japan in 2023, extending that lead last year. Japanese firms have become more pessimistic on the opportunities in China, with many cutting back investments as their revenue falls due to the weak Chinese economy and other factors.

Japanese manufacturing was hit hard when China restricted the export of rare earths to Japan in 2010 amid a political dispute. After that, Japanese industry and government made a concerted push to diversify supply, investing in Australia and elsewhere to reduce some of their reliance on China.

Japan is wary of similar restrictions after Beijing earlier this month added seven rare earths to its export control list in response to punitive tariffs imposed by Washington. Saito said he asked Chinese officials to make the “correct decisions” with regard to the handling of rare earths.

Japan needs to walk a tightrope over US-China relations because it also leans heavily on the US as it sole formal security ally. The largest overseas US military troop presence is based in Japan, and Trump has in recent days resumed his long-standing demand for Tokyo to pay more for US military bases.

But any demands from Washington on Tokyo to downgrade its economic relationship with China would potentially deal Japan a major economic blow.

“It’s going to be really, really bad for Japan if it sees a drop in trade both with the US and China,” said Yu Uchiyama, a professor of political science at the University of Tokyo. “If policymakers say let’s abandon China, business people will of course oppose it.”",1.74559E+12,en,-0.180057511,2025-04-25 05:42:16,"['beyond', 'minister', 'weighing', 'ryosei', 'chiprelated', 'thursday', 'yomiuri', 'manage', 'china', 'side', 'larger', 'monday', 'military', 'import', 'ease', 'jinpings', 'negotiator', 'australia', 'gear', 'return', 'market', 'occasion', 'overtook', 'speculation', 'going', 'democratic', 'investment', 'resumed', 'material', 'expires', 'bring', 'reliance', 'dialling', 'reaching', 'win', 'investing', 'finalise', 'expense', 'striking', 'exchange', 'additional', 'broadcaster', 'coalition', 'good', 'become', 'leverage', 'seek', 'corn', 'similar', 'seeking', 'chinese', 'ministry', 'factor', 'commitment', 'target', 'party', 'issue', 'nikkei', 'person', 'bessent', 'bad', 'provide', 'professor', 'resolutely', 'rather', 'independently', 'agreement', 'bloomberg', 'prioritise', 'nation', 'effort', 'walk', 'health', 'manufacturing', 'country', 'soybean', 'identified', 'amid', 'ally', 'ask', 'made', 'interest', 'smaller', 'former', 'according', 'partner', 'summit', 'cutting', 'collectively', 'day', 'beef', 'treasury', 'seven', 'due', 'april', 'industry', 'relief', 'prime', 'general', 'destination', 'permanent', 'motor', 'time', 'doesnt', 'supply', 'dampened', 'hasnt', 'pessimistic', 'kato', 'hard', 'emergency', 'soon', 'security', 'junior', 'largest', 'pressure', 'friday', 'downgrade', 'weak', 'domestic', 'source', 'boost', 'trip', 'leader', 'pushing', 'drop', 'current', 'package', 'trump', 'presence', 'opportunity', 'economic', 'based', 'opposes', 'restriction', 'business', 'control', 'announced', 'revenue', 'important', 'make', 'reprieve', 'tie', 'caught', 'elsewhere', 'relationship', 'get', 'scott', 'interview', 'uchiyama', 'shanghai', 'regard', 'dispute', 'aligned', 'preparing', 'reported', 'involving', 'potentially', 'ahead', 'approach', 'help', 'abandon', 'lawmaker', 'discussed', 'system', 'imposed', 'want', 'government', 'relation', 'interaction', 'bloc', 'kono', 'reach', 'back', 'delegation', 'reportedly', 'president', 'handling', 'lead', 'washington', 'akazawa', 'letter', 'deal', 'including', 'newspaper', 'careful', 'say', 'present', 'trade', 'saito', 'diversify', 'agriculture', 'decision', 'chain', 'carmaker', 'firm', 'bessents', 'considering', 'strike', 'month', 'last', 'plant', 'course', 'fully', 'automobile', 'request', 'political', 'concerted', 'hope', 'responsibility', 'tightrope', 'multilateral', 'university', 'comment', 'pay', 'overseas', 'regarding', 'maximise', 'longstanding', 'liberal', 'wednesday', 'buying', 'one', 'taro', 'seafood', 'response', 'talk', 'set', 'didnt', 'fall', 'cushion', 'open', 'role', 'warned', 'fly', 'however', 'raw', 'something', 'sign', 'looking', 'trying', 'support', 'japan', 'demand', 'need', 'restricted', 'semiconductor', 'strengthen', 'align', 'playing', 'troop', 'multiple', 'people', 'asked', 'saying', 'review', 'finance', 'let', 'resume', 'recent', 'scheduled', 'economy', 'japanese', 'curbing', 'inc', 'wang', 'afterward', 'ban', 'many', 'bilateral', 'sunday', 'new', 'process', 'biggest', 'komeito', 'hit', 'intends', 'donald', 'work', 'earth', 'secretary', 'passed', 'huning', 'commerce', 'nhk', 'administration', 'export', 'around', 'move', 'blow', 'try', 'card', 'specific', 'deflected', 'june', 'rare', 'conveyed', 'concession', 'wary', 'factory', 'invest', 'occurs', 'series', 'mission', 'year', 'beijing', 'added', 'may', 'question', 'could', 'extending', 'also', 'area', 'official', 'katsunobu', 'science', 'push', 'policymakers', 'sole', 'although', 'group', 'major', 'earlier', 'shigeru', 'ishiba', 'see', 'addressing', 'uschina', 'closing', 'visit', 'really', 'agreed', 'base', 'tariff', 'trading', 'planning', 'round', 'leading', 'requested', 'overview', 'list', 'corp', 'subsequently', 'week', 'company', 'would', 'total', 'tokyo', 'concern', 'towards', 'second', 'public', 'oppose', 'punitive', 'ruling', 'reduce', 'formal', 'foreign', 'immediately', 'importance', 'tetsuo', 'heavily', 'yen', 'toyota', 'lean', 'said', 'correct', 'billion', 'like']",Neutral

“The question is whether Malaysia was a final destination or from Malaysia, it went to somewhere else, which we do not know for certain at this point,” he told reporters.

“But we assessed that there may have been false representation on the final destination of the servers.”

The chips were embedded in servers supplied by Dell and Supermicro to Singapore-based companies, before they went to Malaysia.

Nvidia’s artificial intelligence chips are subject to US export restrictions. It was recently reported that US authorities are investigating whether Chinese AI sensation DeepSeek had circumvented sanctions through third parties in countries such as Malaysia, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates.

Singapore charged three men with fraud last week in connection with the alleged movement of Nvidia chips, after raids were conducted at 22 locations. They are accused of misleading a supplier of servers on the end-user of the items.

Mr Shanmugam said investigations into the three men were carried out independently by Singapore after authorities received an anonymous tip-off and not requested by the US or any other country.

“There has been some speculation linking this case with the potential circumvention of US export controls for advanced Nvidia chips. Now this case is unrelated. It's an independent investigation conducted by Singapore,” he said.

“Investigations showed potential breaches of our domestic laws, and so we moved quickly to deal with it.”",1.74105E+12,en,-0.473196983,2025-03-03 08:51:12,"['certain', 'minister', 'server', 'deal', 'deepseek', 'monday', 'quickly', 'circumvented', 'circumvention', 'export', 'nvidias', 'representation', 'speculation', 'charged', 'raid', 'arab', 'domestic', 'last', 'else', 'sanction', 'mar', 'chip', 'somewhere', 'may', 'singaporebased', 'question', 'three', 'supermicro', 'anonymous', 'emirate', 'men', 'restriction', 'went', 'recently', 'location', 'final', 'investigating', 'united', 'potential', 'unrelated', 'chinese', 'know', 'alleged', 'tipoff', 'control', 'party', 'false', 'linking', 'third', 'sensation', 'advanced', 'independently', 'independent', 'case', 'point', 'item', 'reporter', 'shanmugam', 'accused', 'sent', 'authority', 'requested', 'law', 'country', 'dell', 'embedded', 'nvidia', 'subject', 'misleading', 'enduser', 'affair', 'reported', 'movement', 'week', 'company', 'intelligence', 'assessed', 'breach', 'conducted', 'carried', 'connection', 'received', 'contained', 'artificial', 'moved', 'singapore', 'showed', 'home', 'investigation', 'linked', 'supplied', 'supplier', 'whether', 'malaysia', 'said', 'fraud', 'destination', 'told']",Neutral

The Bera Member of Parliament was seen leaving the MACC headquarters compound at 6.11 pm, after spending seven hours with investigators. He had arrived at the premises at 11 am.

According to sources, the process of recording the statement from Malaysia’s ninth Prime Minister is expected to resume tomorrow at 3 pm.

This marks the eighth time Ismail Sabri has been present at the MACC to assist in the ongoing investigation.

It is understood that the probe is related to the expenditure and procurement of funds for promotional and publicity activities, under the Keluarga Malaysia (Malaysian Family) initiative, during his tenure as prime minister, from August 2021 to November 2022.

The case is being investigated under the MACC Act 2009, and the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001.

export,Alleged fraud involving Nvidia chips: Shanmugam says servers exported to Malaysia might have gone elsewhere,1.74099E+12,AsiaOne,https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/alleged-fraud-involving-nvidia-chips-shanmugam-says-servers-exported-malaysia-might-have,https://news.google.com/read/CBMivwFBVV95cUxQbHR6MUh0WUZpNno5T3MtUFlBN1BiQjMxbXhOV3phNXhkMWR5dzMydURWYjd0YVNXaDE5QlJrY1dwWUI4a1Z1S0dHQVB5RDExN0VCcjFpaUhpRXhBVjhVR3hnaG9JTWJxUlNrdHBlcksxOWg5cWlyS1h4SkxZU0JONzBtN3haN0w2ZE5jQXR6Vm1nU05OcTMtSXdUMHRWMlV3d1oxSFEtVTlBUUVWOFg1eExCcURPdlV5b08tUWxEbw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/alleged-fraud-involving-nvidia-chips-shanmugam-says-servers-exported-malaysia-might-have,"SINGAPORE — An anonymous tip-off about computer servers that might contain Nvidia chips being exported to Malaysia, and possibly to an unknown final destination, sparked off a police investigation.

This alert did not come from any country or sovereign entity, but the claim was serious enough to get the Singapore authorities to launch an independent investigation, said Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam at a media briefing on March 3 at the Treasury.

The servers arrived in Singapore from the US before being exported to Malaysia.

But whether they ended up in Malaysia, or another country, is being looked into, he said.

Three men were charged with fraud on Feb 27 in a case allegedly linked to chipmaker Nvidia.

Shanmugam said preliminary investigations show servers from US firms Dell and Supermicro were sent to Singapore-based companies. The servers were then exported to Malaysia.

He said these servers likely contained items subjected to export controls by the US.

Said Shanmugam: ""The question is whether Malaysia was a final destination or from Malaysia it went to somewhere else, which we do not know for certain at this point.

""But we assess that there may have been false representation on the final destination of the servers.""

He said if there were false representations within Singapore about the servers' final destination, then an offence under Singapore laws has been committed.

He added Singapore has contacted Malaysia and the US for more information.

The Straits Times asked if the case was linked to the Nvidia case, that was addressed in Parliament on Feb 18.

Shanmugam said he could not reveal too much as investigations were ongoing.

But he said: ""We assess that the servers may contain Nvidia chips. I think that's the highest I can put it at, at this point.""

Shanmugam later said: ""We will always be happy to work with any country that discloses information to us which suggests that our laws have been breached, and we will take firm and decisive action.""

The US is looking into the potential circumvention of its export controls for advanced Nvidia chips, after China's artificial intelligence (AI) firm DeepSeek launched a free AI tool in January that wiped out around US$1 trillion (S$1.34 trillion) off the value of US tech stocks.

[[nid:714079]]

This comes despite the tight restrictions the US had imposed on semiconductor firms in their exports to China.

Lawmakers in the United States had singled out Singapore in a letter in January urging National Security Adviser Mike Waltz to subject countries to strict licensing requirements if they were not willing to crack down on shipments to China.

On Feb 27, three men were each handed one count for fraud.

Singaporeans Aaron Woon Guo Jie, 41, and Alan Wei Zhaolun, 49, and Chinese national Li Ming, 51, had allegedly committed the acts between 2023 and 2024.

Shanmugam said Singapore will remain an open and inclusive business hub but local laws must be respected.

He said: ""We welcome reputable businesses to operate from here, to be part of our business environment, and to contribute to our growth.

""But we will not tolerate individuals and companies violating our laws, or taking advantage of their association with Singapore to circumvent export controls of other countries.""

The men who were charged on Feb 27 face a jail term of up to 20 years, a fine, or both.

According to court documents, Chinese national Li had allegedly committed fraud in 2023 against an unnamed supplier of servers by lying that the procured servers would be going to a company called Luxuriate Your Life.

Business records in Singapore show the company was incorporated in January 2021.

An archived page of the company's website, which has since been taken down, indicates it dabbled in network equipment sales, internet data centres, network communications, and computing equipment.

Wei and Woon were charged with conspiring to commit fraud against another unnamed supplier of servers by lying about where the procured servers would end up.

Business records show Wei is listed as the director of several firms in Singapore, including Achieva Tech Allianz, Altrics Global Services, Aperia Cloud Services and its subsidiaries, A-Speed Infotech, and Aurica.

Woon is listed as the director of car dealership Ace Autohaus. He also owns the pet food shop Dane's Cosmo.

All three will return to the State Courts on March 7.

Nvidia's latest financial results showed that 22 per cent of its third-quarter billings were to Singapore, making it the biggest buyer of its chips after the US.

On Feb 18, Second Minister for Trade and Industry Tan See Leng told Parliament that products sold by Nvidia to Singapore that were physically delivered here represent less than one per cent of the chipmaker's overall revenue.

Dr Tan added the remainder of Nvidia's revenue billed to business entities in Singapore did not involve physical shipments into the country.

He said Nvidia's products are mainly deployed here for major enterprises and the Government.

Dr Tan added: ""If a company in Singapore is engaged in deceptive or dishonest practices to evade export controls that it is subject to, we will investigate, and we will take the appropriate action in accordance with Singapore laws.

""It is in our national interest to secure access to leading-edge technology and to maintain the integrity of our business environment.""

Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan added during the Parliament session that Singapore was not legally obliged to enforce the unilateral export measures of countries around the world.

""But we will enforce the multilateral agreed-upon export control regimes,"" he said.

In response to these pressing issues, Sri Lanka’s Department of Agrarian Development (DAD), in collaboration with the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and Unmiti Pvt. Ltd., launched the GeoGoviya Smart Farming Platform initiative in 2022. The name comes from the word goviya meaning farmer in the Sinhalese language. The platform was then upgraded in 2023 to reflect improved technologies and infrastructure. This allowed its use to expand across public and private sectors and institutionalizing the platform as the National Digital Agricultural Data Platform.

GeoGoviya empowers farmers with data-driven insights, enhancing productivity, resilience and sustainability as it addresses the needs of Sri Lanka’s agricultural community. It integrates advanced climate services, geospatial analytics and smart farming technologies and provides real-time data on weather patterns, land use, soil conditions, crop health and water availability. This enables farmers to make informed decisions tailored to their specific agricultural needs. Using GeoGoviya, DAD is expected to revolutionize crop management through advanced data collection and analysis, securing the future of farming in Sri Lanka.

The platform also provides drought monitoring, and early warning systems through the South Asia Drought Monitoring System (SADMS) Platform. It uses geospatial mapping for efficient land use, soil health assessments and crop monitoring. Farmers receive tailored recommendations for irrigation schedules, pest management and fertilizer application through user-friendly dashboards designed for smallholder farmers with limited digital literacy.

GeoGoviya also supports real-time monitoring and reporting providing DAD with a farmer and land registry. The platform supports comprehensive field data collection with geo-tagging, QR code identifiers and offline data sync capabilities.

In an era where climate change and resource constraints threaten agricultural sustainability, GeoGoviya is transforming the sector with data-driven decision-making. By equipping users with real-time insights, the platform enhances resource allocation and policy-making. With a database of 1.82 million paddy land records and 1.42 million farmers, it serves as the backbone of CultivateX, a product developed by IWMI that delivers customized agro-climate advisories. By integrating agronomic recommendations from Sri Lanka’s National Agriculture Information and Communication Centre, these advisories help farmers mitigate climate risks and adopt resilient farming practices.

GeoGoviya has also streamlined financial assistance, eliminating duplicate records and savingSri Lanka just over US$ 1.6 million, ensuring faster, more accurate cash transfers. Its user-friendly mobile and web applications improve access for smallholder farmers. Blockchain-based land registries, Keyhole Markup Language databases and screening algorithms enhance resource transparency and efficiency. Policymakers use GeoGoviya’s analytics to develop evidence-based agricultural strategies. By integrating technology with sustainability, GeoGoviya is optimizing farm operations, strengthening resilience, and paving the way for a climate-smart future.

GeoGoviya Platform has already made significant strides in transforming Sri Lanka’s agricultural landscape.

Uganda has unveiled bold ambitions to grow its economy tenfold, from $50 billion A9about Shs2 trillion) in the 2022/23 financial year to $500 billion by 2040, anchored by an aggressive investment drive and intensified economic diplomacy.

Speaking at the Pearl of Africa Trade Expo in Kuala Lumpur, Uganda’s Finance Minister Matia Kasaija highlighted the country’s stable macroeconomic environment, liberalized economy, affordable industrial power tariffs, and sustained peace and security as key factors making Uganda an attractive investment destination.

“We are seeing consistent growth in foreign direct investment, from $1.2 billion in 2020 to $3.0 billion in 2023,” Kasaija said.

“With the private sector contributing 80% of GDP, Uganda presents increasing demand for intermediate goods and services, making it a fertile ground for manufacturing, agro-industrialization, and innovation.”

Organized by the Uganda High Commission in Malaysia, the expo is the first East African Community trade show recorded under ASEAN, which comprises 10 Southeast Asian nations.

The initiative is a product of Uganda’s growing emphasis on economic and commercial diplomacy to tap into the expansive ASEAN market.

Kasaija called on Malaysian and ASEAN investors to partner with Uganda in key sectors including tourism, mineral development, oil and gas, ICT, and the creative economy.

“Malaysia can help Uganda shift from low-value to high-value exports,” he noted.

The International Monetary Fund has projected Uganda’s economy to grow at 7.5% in 2025, ranking it among the world’s fastest-growing.

Kasaija said Uganda’s strategy is to fully monetize its economy, structurally transform it, and boost export competitiveness through value addition.

He also revealed that Uganda has added 31 new manufactured products to its export basket in the last 15 years, including concentrated milk, butter, casein, and hair products.

Minister for Energy Ruth Nankabirwa also pitched Uganda’s potential in the energy and mining sectors, revealing that only 40% of Uganda’s petroleum has been explored.

She said the country is now fully covered by high-resolution airborne geophysical surveys and is aggressively seeking investment in electricity generation, mineral processing, and distribution.

“We have the data, the resources, and the incentives. Uganda is ready,” Nankabirwa told the forum.

On the sidelines of the event, Uganda’s delegation held bilateral talks with Malaysian government officials led by Deputy Minister of Investment, Trade and Industry, YB Liew Chin Tong.

The discussions emphasized Malaysia’s interest in Uganda’s agriculture sector.

According to State Minister for Agriculture Bright Rwamirama, Uganda boasts 16.5 million cattle, 18.5 million goats and sheep, and 8 million pigs, offering wide investment potential in animal husbandry, meat processing, and agribusiness.

The benchmark palm oil contract FCPO1! for May delivery on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange lost 71 ringgit, or 1.56%, to close at 4,483 ringgit ($1,004.26) per metric ton.

""The futures are mirroring sell-off in Chicago's soyoil futures and in South American markets on Friday night and weakness in Dalian's palm olein and soyoil futures in Asian hours,"" said Anilkumar Bagani, head of research at Mumbai-based vegetable oil broker Sunvin Group.

""The market has also followed the weaker Malaysian palm oil export performance in February.""

Palm oil is affected by the price movements in related oils as it competes for a share of the global vegetable oils market.

Malaysian palm oil products exports in February are estimated to fall 8.5%-11%, according to independent inspection company AmSpec Agri Malaysia and cargo surveyor Intertek Testing Services.

Plantation and Commodities Minister Datuk Johari Abdul Ghani highlighted EFE 2025’s significance in boosting gross domestic growth and reinforcing buyer confidence in Malaysian-made furniture, with an estimated sales target of RM3.5 billion this year.

“This milestone highlights EFE’s reputation for delivering high-quality Malaysian furniture that meets diverse market demands,” Johari said in his speech, which was read out by Deputy Minister Chan Foong Hin at the event today.

Johari said the furniture sector is equally important, citing Malaysia’s RM9.9 billion wooden furniture exports in 2024.

“This accounted for 43.2% of the country’s total timber export value. Congratulations to our local players on achieving an 8.4% growth in export value compared to the previous year, reinforcing the sector’s competitiveness in the global market.

“The furniture industry’s performance is an impressive achievement, reflecting its resilience and ability to adapt to global challenges,” he said.

Meanwhile, Chan addressed industry concerns over potential trade challenges, particularly the risk of higher US tariffs.

He noted that more than 50% (RM5 billion) of Malaysia’s furniture exports are destined for the US, making it a key market for local manufacturers.

“Any tariff increase would pose significant challenges to businesses that depend on this market. While no official announcement has been made regarding Malaysia, concerns have been rising due to discussions about a possible 25% tariff across all products under President Donald Trump’s trade policies.

“Exporters are already preparing for potential disruptions, as such a tariff could make Malaysian furniture less competitive in the US market. The uncertainty alone has sparked industry-wide worries about trade stability,” Chan told reporters after the event.

He assured industry players that the government is closely monitoring developments. “Asean, as a regional bloc, will present a collective stance to the US at an upcoming special summit,” he said.

While details of the diplomatic effort remain undisclosed, Malaysia is expected to push for policies that protect its export interests.

Beyond furniture, Chan noted that Malaysia’s glove industry will also face the risk, as the US remains one of its top buyers.

“Any increase in tariffs could affect export revenue. Both sectors fall under the purview of the Plantation and Commodities Ministry, and the government is committed to ensuring minimal disruptions to these industries,” he said.

To address industry concerns, the Plantation and Commoditie Ministry will continue engaging with key stakeholders to gather feedback.

“The information will be shared with the Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry (Miti), the primary agency responsible for trade negotiations. This collaboration aims to ensure that Malaysia presents a strong case in trade discussions with the US,” Chan said.

He said exporters worry that higher tariffs could lead to a drop in demand, forcing companies to explore alternative markets or adjust pricing strategies.

Rabat: Specialised global fruit and vegetable market analysis website EastFruit has announced that Morocco has achieved an unprecedented feat, becoming the world leader in fruit and vegetable exports. The website noted that the Kingdom ranks among the three fastest-growing agricultural exporters globally.

This remarkable success is attributed to Morocco’s adoption of advanced #PrecisionIrrigation technologies and the implementation of innovative agricultural practices adapted to the country’s characteristic #AridClimate. This leadership also reflects the sound management of soils and investment in a sophisticated post-harvest #Infrastructure, ensuring the quality and safety of products.

In a move to further enhance this success and expand markets, a joint trade mission between the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)1 is set to launch, targeting promising Asian markets. This initiative aims to open markets in #Singapore, #Malaysia, and other countries seeking sustainable and high-quality agricultural products.

This new achievement underscores Morocco’s growing position as a regional and global agricultural powerhouse, and its ability to achieve self-sufficiency and meet the increasing global demand for premium agricultural products.",1.74527E+12,en,0.894001246,2025-04-20 19:12:57,"['morocco', 'postharvest', 'rank', 'bank', 'exporter', 'analysis', 'achievement', 'export', 'ensuring', 'leadership', 'reconstruction', 'market', 'trade', 'ebrd', 'move', 'agriculture', 'globally', 'enhance', 'investment', 'food', 'sound', 'mission', 'linkedin', 'world', 'underscore', 'selfsufficiency', 'leader', 'unprecedented', 'highquality', 'three', 'eastfruit', 'organization', 'also', 'increasing', 'specialised', 'management', 'regional', 'fruit', 'facebook', 'rabat', 'seeking', 'united', 'adapted', 'european', 'achieved', 'set', 'announced', 'kingdom', 'technology', 'open', 'safety', 'attributed', 'position', 'remarkable', 'characteristic', 'advanced', 'premium', 'joint', 'product', 'among', 'noted', 'development', 'achieve', 'nation', 'adoption', 'targeting', 'demand', 'promising', 'global', 'website', 'vegetable', 'country', 'becoming', 'fao', 'ability', 'agricultural', 'success', 'implementation', 'innovative', 'expand', 'soil', 'meet', 'share', 'asian', 'sophisticated', 'aim', 'feat', 'growing', 'practice', 'fastestgrowing', 'initiative', 'reflects', 'powerhouse', 'launch', 'quality', 'sustainable', 'new', 'twitter']",Positive
export,Singapore Authorities Uncover Potential Export Control Violations of Nvidia Chips to Malaysia,1.74101E+12,Goody Feed,https://goodyfeed.com/nvidia-chips-singapore/,https://news.google.com/read/CBMiWEFVX3lxTE1kVE9jMlROWi1JcDJnTjFqdFJkQXptNFhBYThIazY2ZG9vekxYS2szeVlCZ3EwTEQwdC10Uk5NaDVRM1JNZ2ZnMVBVdy14ZERIMXd0bzJEVlk?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://goodyfeed.com/nvidia-chips-singapore/,"An anonymous tip-off about computer servers potentially containing Nvidia chips being exported to Malaysia sparked a police investigation by Singapore authorities. Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam revealed this during a media briefing on 3 March at the Treasury.

The alert was not from any country or sovereign entity but was serious enough to prompt an independent investigation by Singapore.

Preliminary findings show servers from US firms Dell and Supermicro were sent to Singapore-based companies before being exported to Malaysia.

The case comes amid US scrutiny of potential circumvention of export controls for advanced Nvidia chips. This follows Chinese artificial intelligence firm DeepSeek’s launch of a free AI tool in January that reportedly caused a significant drop in US tech stock values.

Watch this video to know more about DeepSeek:

US lawmakers had singled out Singapore in a January letter urging National Security Adviser Mike Waltz to subject countries to strict licensing requirements if they failed to crack down on shipments to China.

Nvidia’s latest financial results showed 22 percent of its third-quarter billings were to Singapore, making the Republic the biggest buyer of its chips after the US.

Second Minister for Trade and Industry Tan See Leng told Parliament on 18 February that products physically delivered to Singapore represent less than 1 percent of Nvidia’s overall revenue.

Singapore Police Investigation Uncovers Potential Export Control Violations

Mr Shanmugam stated the servers likely contained items subject to export controls by the US. Authorities are investigating whether Malaysia was the final destination or if the servers were moved elsewhere.

“The question is whether Malaysia was a final destination or, from Malaysia, it went to somewhere else, which we do not know for certain at this point,” Mr Shanmugam said.

He added, “We assess that there may have been false representation on the final destination of the servers.”

If false statements were made within Singapore about the servers’ final destination, this would constitute an offense under Singapore laws.

The investigation led to three men being charged with fraud on 27 February. Singaporeans Aaron Woon Guo Jie, 41, and Alan Wei Zhaolun, 49, along with Chinese national Li Ming, 51, allegedly committed the offenses between 2023 and 2024.

Li allegedly lied to an unnamed supplier in 2023, claiming procured servers would go to a company called Luxuriate Your Life.

Wei and Woon were charged with conspiring to commit fraud against another unnamed supplier by misrepresenting where the procured servers would end up.

The men face jail terms of up to 20 years, a fine, or both. They will return to the State Courts on 7 March.

Singapore authorities conducted raids at 22 locations in connection with the case.

International Cooperation and Singapore’s Export Control Stance

Singapore has contacted Malaysia and the US for additional information to assist with investigations.

Since the supply companies are US-linked, Singapore requires information from American authorities. Similarly, details on server movement within or beyond Malaysia fall under Malaysian jurisdiction.

“If the servers did contain US export-controlled items, we have told the US that we would be happy to work with them and support any investigations in the US on that,” Mr Shanmugam said.

He noted Singapore is likely not the only transit point for such shipments, stating: “As you can see from this case, the servers went from Singapore to a country other than China.”

Mr Shanmugam emphasized that Singapore welcomes businesses but will not tolerate violations of local laws.

“We welcome good companies to operate from here, to be part of our business environment, and to contribute to our growth. But we will not tolerate individuals and companies violating our laws, or taking advantage of their association with Singapore to circumvent export controls of other countries,” he said.

Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan previously stated that Singapore is not legally obliged to enforce unilateral export measures of other countries but will enforce multilaterally agreed-upon export control regimes.

Mr Shanmugam added that countries in the trade and supply chain must work together to properly enforce their domestic laws within their jurisdictions.

“As you can see, the issue is not with the law. We have the laws. It’s with enforcement, and we are enforcing,” he said. “But where you have an international chain of events, it will not be possible for any one country to deal with this by itself.”",1.74105E+12,en,-0.42132923,2025-03-03 13:42:53,"['beyond', 'procured', 'certain', 'minister', 'biggest', 'regime', 'failed', 'letter', 'server', 'jie', 'allegedly', 'supply', 'deal', 'aaron', 'work', 'deepseek', 'serious', 'china', 'enforcing', 'american', 'circumvent', 'buyer', 'video', 'cooperation', 'mike', 'circumvention', 'export', 'nvidias', 'tool', 'strict', 'sovereign', 'adviser', 'return', 'trade', 'security', 'finding', 'representation', 'committed', 'unilateral', 'constitute', 'agreedupon', 'charged', 'another', 'chain', 'face', 'firm', 'raid', 'exportcontrolled', 'court', 'domestic', 'properly', 'else', 'january', 'scrutiny', 'year', 'within', 'term', 'balakrishnan', 'value', 'chip', 'requires', 'somewhere', 'must', 'drop', 'billing', 'added', 'may', 'tan', 'singaporebased', 'follows', 'question', 'malaysian', 'commit', 'three', 'together', 'supermicro', 'come', 'taking', 'event', 'deepseeks', 'international', 'enforce', 'preliminary', 'anonymous', 'show', 'watch', 'individual', 'alan', 'caused', 'additional', 'since', 'republic', 'good', 'men', 'claiming', 'went', 'wei', 'contribute', 'location', 'final', 'shipment', 'offense', 'stance', 'operate', 'containing', 'crack', 'end', 'business', 'obliged', 'investigating', 'guo', 'potential', 'uncovers', 'one', 'medium', 'chinese', 'unnamed', 'state', 'association', 'tipoff', 'know', 'latest', 'similarly', 'leng', 'enforcement', 'control', 'revealed', 'significant', 'entity', 'previously', 'called', 'possible', 'false', 'less', 'fall', 'revenue', 'issue', 'free', 'thirdquarter', 'led', 'parliament', 'detail', 'stock', 'happy', 'waltz', 'advanced', 'tech', 'requirement', 'see', 'life', 'elsewhere', 'independent', 'case', 'product', 'point', 'statement', 'item', 'emphasized', 'woon', 'zhaolun', 'financial', 'shanmugam', 'support', 'noted', 'prompt', 'exported', 'enough', 'sent', 'briefing', 'violating', 'stating', 'violation', 'result', 'uslinked', 'authority', 'measure', 'information', 'legally', 'law', 'overall', 'country', 'dell', 'amid', 'jurisdiction', 'nvidia', 'subject', 'advantage', 'contacted', 'affair', 'conspiring', 'movement', 'potentially', 'company', 'national', 'urging', 'made', 'stated', 'growth', 'intelligence', 'would', 'lied', 'misrepresenting', 'licensing', 'delivered', 'lawmaker', 'conducted', 'connection', 'contained', 'second', 'transit', 'part', 'february', 'singaporean', 'contain', 'artificial', 'moved', 'singapore', 'percent', 'environment', 'foreign', 'showed', 'home', 'physically', 'investigation', 'assist', 'local', 'supplier', 'assess', 'alert', 'treasury', 'likely', 'whether', 'luxuriate', 'multilaterally', 'ming', 'tolerate', 'industry', 'malaysia', 'reportedly', 'police', 'said', 'vivian', 'represent', 'jail', 'launch', 'sparked', 'making', 'fraud', 'along', 'told', 'destination', 'march', 'computer', 'fine', 'singled', 'welcome']",Neutral

export,South Korea’s early trade data show exports shrank after tariffs,1.7452E+12,The Malaysian Reserve,themalaysianreserve.com,https://news.google.com/read/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxONjVzcU1xdTBsNTM3WVp4RmR3RnVGY1ZHSk5GNnpocEdjRi00R0laRjlUNHpyU2FQV1F2clNhbmlsQVpOMVJMOW5Ydk5IS0ZMM2FISnFBb0t5NTJBdlhZV1drZXRKVnNlWDJ6VDV5MkR0WDh6RkxtRklkTTNKa2FOeHAyREdJcEZUejVYS21pWF9mRUdVSlFQYS1WazZBNkVEbWJSWTFGZmc2bms?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://themalaysianreserve.com/2025/04/21/south-koreas-early-trade-data-show-exports-shrank-after-tariffs/,"SOUTH Korea’s early trade data showed that exports contracted so far this month after Donald Trump stepped up his tariff campaign, clouding the growth outlook for the Asian export powerhouse.

The value of shipments adjusted for working-day differences fell 5.2% from a year earlier in the first 20 days of April, according to data released Monday by the customs office. That compared with a 5.5% rise reported earlier for the full month of March.

After hiking duties on imports of metals in March, Trump imposed a 25% tariff on auto imports and a 10% levy on all other shipments earlier this month. The slowing momentum for exports underscores the risks to South Korea’s export-driven economy from Trump’s protectionist policies.

The data will be closely watched for clues on how Trump’s protectionist policies are playing out in the real world.

South Korean officials have said they are looking to cut a “big” deal in talks with the US but it’s unclear how quickly an agreement can be reached as they prepare to elect the country’s next leader on June 3. Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun and Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok will travel to Washington this week to kick start trade negotiations.

Unadjusted exports fell 5.2% while overall imports decreased by 11.8%, resulting in a trade shortfall of $100 million.

South Korea is the US’s sixth-biggest trading partner, with the Asian country’s surplus jumping about 25% in 2024 from the previous year to about $55.7 billion, a factor that Trump focused on when deciding so-called reciprocal levies.

The auto tariff presents a real threat to South Korean automakers since the US accounted for nearly half of the nation’s $70.8 billion worth of vehicle exports in 2024, according to government data. Automobiles and auto-parts are among South Korea’s biggest export items to the US.

If the Trump administration decides to press ahead with plans to impose tariffs on semiconductor imports, it could further hurt the South Korea industry that has been a bedrock of the country’s export-led economy.

The Bank of Korea decided to keep its benchmark interest rate steady at 2.75% last week even as it cited a significant increase in downside risks to growth due to trade policies.

“The overall exports momentum is weak with growth slowing in April due to deteriorating trade conditions after expanding slightly in March,” Governor Rhee Chang-yong said in a post-decision press conference.

The bank said growth weakened more than expected due to the impacts of US trade policy and domestic political uncertainty, warning that the economy could see negative growth in the first quarter. –BLOOMBERG",1.74527E+12,en,-0.547031283,2025-04-21 01:30:55,"['full', 'minister', 'biggest', 'washington', 'nearly', 'donald', 'cut', 'early', 'deal', 'workingday', 'outlook', 'clouding', 'monday', 'policy', 'bank', 'import', 'quickly', 'administration', 'real', 'export', 'decreased', 'present', 'watched', 'condition', 'trade', 'deciding', 'surplus', 'automaker', 'uncertainty', 'expected', 'warning', 'start', 'closely', 'clue', 'conference', 'postdecision', 'far', 'june', 'plan', 'travel', 'adjusted', 'month', 'weak', 'last', 'domestic', 'automobile', 'world', 'year', 'underscore', 'political', 'ahn', 'worth', 'value', 'levy', 'leader', 'negotiation', 'unadjusted', 'could', 'trump', 'difference', 'cited', 'increase', 'metal', 'autoparts', 'since', 'korea', 'official', 'duty', 'kick', 'resulting', 'shipment', 'hiking', 'exportdriven', 'reached', 'shortfall', 'factor', 'hurt', 'earlier', 'rise', 'momentum', 'talk', 'impose', 'significant', 'impact', 'expanding', 'threat', 'focused', 'protectionist', 'prepare', 'fell', 'sangmok', 'decides', 'previous', 'dukgeun', 'see', 'agreement', 'sixthbiggest', 'bloomberg', 'socalled', 'among', 'looking', 'tariff', 'item', 'deteriorating', 'trading', 'benchmark', 'campaign', 'big', 'accounted', 'nation', 'released', 'keep', 'million', 'overall', 'first', 'elect', 'country', 'semiconductor', 'exportled', 'jumping', 'downside', 'choi', 'custom', 'playing', 'decided', 'auto', 'south', 'bedrock', 'reported', 'week', 'ahead', 'office', 'negative', 'growth', 'interest', 'slightly', 'governor', 'finance', 'according', 'korean', 'compared', 'partner', 'asian', 'imposed', 'unclear', 'half', 'government', 'economy', 'weakened', 'reciprocal', 'stepped', 'rate', 'rhee', 'day', 'showed', 'vehicle', 'next', 'data', 'due', 'april', 'industry', 'powerhouse', 'said', 'slowing', 'even', 'billion', 'risk', 'contracted', 'quarter', 'changyong', 'march', 'press', 'steady']",Negative

China is reaching out to the world to make trade deals amid President Donald Trump’s push to isolate the nation by dishing out massive tariffs.

So far, China has made inroads with Vietnam, Malaysia, and Europe amid Trump’s tariffs threatening to stifle the economy of the world’s second-largest market. Trump’s tariffs, which have now risen to a whopping total of 245% for some goods, aim to cripple China by cutting access to its largest export partner and cut off the nation from other trading partners, sources told the Wall Street Journal Tuesday.

“This is the first time that anyone of any consequence has stood up and said, ‘no more,’” Stephen Yates, senior research Fellow for China and National Security Policy at the Heritage Foundation, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “We are going to renegotiate the terms of our engagement in a way that is more fair to my country’s interests, and there are some priorities that you’re going to have to address.”

Vietnam accounts for nearly 4% of all exports from China in 2023, totaling $135 billion worth in goods, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC) data. Vietnam signed a trade deal with China during Xi Jinping’s visit on Monday, further strengthening the ties between the two communist countries.

Vietnam is also a large U.S. trade partner, exporting over $136 billion of goods to the United States in 2024, according to U.S. Census data.

Malaysia accounted for around 1.91% of all Chinese exports, valued at $65.5 billion, in 2023. Xi Jinping stressed cooperation between the two nations on Wednesday, with Malaysia also supplying the CCP with nearly 66% of its crude oil exports in 2023.

“Beijing believes it has advantages in its neighboring region and Trump’s volatile policy is harming America’s credibility and soft power in Asia,” Zhao Minghao, professor of international studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, told the WSJ.

China has also shown an interest in partnering with Europe amid Trump’s tariffs, with Beijing being the second-largest trading partner with the EU behind the U.S. Recently, the EU considered dropping tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, instead setting minimum prices on the products.

China’s economy was already in a precarious position before the onset of the trade war, in part due to an ongoing struggle to fix a dismal real estate market and a rapidly aging population. Moreover, China is struggling to find buyers for its large amounts of cheap goods it once sent to the U.S. en masse.

Trump signed an executive order Wednesday directing Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick to investigate the possibility and feasibility of new tariffs on “critical minerals,” which include cobalt, lithium, nickel, and others frequently used to produce advanced goods.

“China seems to think it can survive without the United States making substantial investments in China,” Yates told the DCNF. “It doesn’t seem to believe that after tariffs, COVID, fentany,l and other activities, America and others just might be serious about re-balancing our supply chains. So they seem to be not in a panic, but somewhat arrogant, if you ask me.”

export,US tariffs can boost China-ASEAN trade,1.74519E+12,China Daily,www.chinadaily.com.cn,https://news.google.com/read/CBMifkFVX3lxTE5CSHVhUHdOdzRJcjRsSnpDR0JIOTFNRlJya3NQQUh0Qk5ROGMyUXI5WWtOOVJuU0VCOTNfZlJjZ1J4d1kyaHJfekxURE4zU0lCN1d3eEZYNjIybUNjWkE1Xy1TcWtuSFpLdkFZcldZNUxIYVBQN2RER3hMcmt6Zw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202504/21/WS68057fe8a3104d9fd38207d4.html,"MA XUEJING/CHINA DAILY

President Xi Jinping's visit to Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia comes at a time when China and most of the Southeast Asian region are working on strategies to offset the impacts of a new round of high tariffs by the United States on their imports.

Apart from China, which has traditionally been the largest source of imports for the US, most Southeast Asian countries are major exporters to the US. With the US administration deciding to ""correct the goods trade imbalances"" that the US has with its trade partners, the economies that have large trade surpluses with the US have been hit with the highest tariffs.

Currently, the US has announced accumulated tariffs of 245 percent on Chinese imports. Also, after the US announced the imposition of reciprocal tariffs on April 2, the tariffs on exports from several US trade partners have increased significantly. Among Southeast Asian countries, Cambodia has attracted the highest tariff hike — 49 percent — followed by Laos, Vietnam and Myanmar, with tariffs of 48 percent, 46 percent and 44 percent respectively. Malaysian goods, meanwhile, face 24 percent tariffs.

Although the US administration has delayed most of the tariffs by 90 days, a baseline tariff of 10 percent has been levied since the announcement of the reciprocal tariffs on practically all US trade partners, including the countries mentioned above. Further higher tariffs on specific countries will come into effect after 90 days.

In the intervening period, countries are expected to individually negotiate with the US on a variety of mutual tariff and non-tariff market access barriers. The success of these negotiations will determine the eventual country-specific tariffs.

Since the beginning of the United States' trade war against China in 2018, Southeast Asia has attracted considerable attention, because of the shifting of a number of investment projects and parts of industry and supply chains from the Chinese mainland to various Southeast Asian countries. The relocation was due to the producers wanting to export goods to the US from locations that didn't attract the kind of tariffs that products from China did.

Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia are important countries in this regard. Exports from these countries have been getting entry into the US at low MFN (most-favored-nation) tariffs that are about 2.5 percent on most items. In addition, some of these countries have also been enjoying preferential market access through the US Generalized System of Preferences.

However, the new set of tariffs will significantly impact the access exports from these countries will get to the US market. Therefore, these countries need to identify new markets and diversify their exports.

Reciprocal tariffs introduced by the US are likely to have the wider impact of encouraging more trade diversion from the US market. This is expected to develop into a US plus one strategy. In this respect, the main exporters from Southeast Asia to the US, such as Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia, will look to export more to China.

As the world's second-largest economy, China is the most important regional market that Southeast Asian economies will look forward to diversifying their exports. This intention also complements China's efforts to boost domestic consumption, particularly those of imports.

Increasing imports from Southeast Asia, particularly through existing trade agreements, such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and the China-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement, should be economically beneficial for China.

Having access to more inexpensive imports from the region that will meet both its consumption and intermediate input requirements can help China shift more of its domestic production to high-tech areas. More imports from the region will also help support the large online retail market in the country that can source more goods from the region and offer a wider variety to domestic customers.

These prospects will also encourage Chinese businesses to expand their capacities in Southeast Asia with an eye to making products for the mainland market.

The current volatility in world trade caused by the US tariffs will lead to the realignment of global production networks, the functioning of supply chains and cross-border patterns of regional trade. It is quite likely that one of the most prominent shifts could be increased trade between China and Southeast Asia with several Southeast Asian countries becoming major exporters to China, and Chinese investment further increasing in the region. President Xi's visit to Southeast Asia and his meetings with regional leaders could mark the beginning of this new transition.

The decision is the result of an investigation started last year at the request of seven U.S. solar manufacturers, which argued that companies in Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Malaysia were exporting solar components at artificially low prices, made possible by support from China.

The highest rates, 3,521 percent, landed on Cambodian companies that stopped cooperating with the investigation. The inquiry found that, on average, solar cells from the four Southeast Asian countries were being subsidized at effective rates of 34 percent to 652 percent, a calculation that included the combined impact of dumping and government support.

KUALA LUMPUR, April 24 (Bernama) -- The Malaysia MADANI concept introduced by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim as a framework to drive the nation towards becoming a developed, prosperous and competitive country can be expanded to the ASEAN level. Sunway Centre for Planetary Health, Sunway University executive director Prof Tan Sri Dr Jemilah Mahmood said this is because the core values emphasized in the concept such as justice and humanity are aligned with ASEAN's aspirations, with Malaysia serving as chair this year. ""To the Prime Minister, I would say I love the Malaysia MADANI concept because it is in line with planetary health, it's in line with sustainability. We need an ASEAN MADANI.

""I think that begins with looking at the whole issue of climate, peace and security. We need him to come out of his chairmanship, winning the whole issue around conflict, finding a peace resolution,"" she said during Bernama TV's ""ASEAN: Dari Kuala Lumpur ke Dunia"" programme, hosted by Gerard Ratnam tonight. Dr Jemilah said we have to find a peaceful end to the conflicts in the region, particularly in Myanmar. ""It's an appeal to him. As tough as it is, we are all behind him and we want him to succeed. We want him to take on climate change, biodiversity loss and the planetary crisis we are facing very, very seriously.

""We need to look at a rapid energy transition for the region and that these crises are intergenerational. We owe it to the future generations to put into place now the mechanisms that will help make their future lives better than ours,"" she said. Dr Jemilah added that Malaysia's image as a respected nation on the global stage can be used as a form of soft power when engaging with any international country on arising issues.

With exports to the US nearly frozen due to high tariffs, and traditional markets in Latin America, Africa, and East Asia pulling back, China is struggling to offload its massive stock of consumer goods, electronics, and vehicles.

President Xi Jinping has been making diplomatic rounds in Southeast Asia, including visits to Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia, hoping to create new trade opportunities. Yet, these efforts seem more desperate than strategic, especially given the lukewarm economic performance of these countries and their cautious stance toward angering the US.

Domestically, Xi faces rising discontent within the Chinese Communist Party, with concerns that continued US tariffs could cripple China’s industrial base. To make matters worse, foreign investments are flowing out of China. Unemployment fears are growing, and flashy displays like robots running marathons do little to distract from the reality on the ground.

While some believe selling unsold goods in the domestic market could ease the crisis, China’s internal demand—consuming only half of what it produces—is insufficient to absorb the excess. Clearance sales and incentives won’t be enough.

China’s international image is further strained by allegations of providing technical and satellite support to Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who are attacking Western commercial ships in the Red Sea. These actions may provoke retaliation or diplomatic isolation from Europe and North America.

As social media bypasses state censorship, the Chinese public is becoming increasingly aware of the turmoil. Internally, a power struggle may be brewing, and externally, China’s diplomatic and economic isolation is deepening. The once unstoppable manufacturing giant now faces a critical moment of reckoning.

KENINGAU:

Keningau Parti Warisan Sabah Division Chief, Rasinin Kautis urged the government to create a financial assistance system for flood victims in Sabah.

Referring to the Sabah State Legislative Assembly meeting last week, he said they discussed the issue on the Federal Government’s Bantuan Wang Ihsan (BWI) of RM1,000 to flood victims in the state.

“According to the Assistant Minister to the Chief Minister, Nizam Abu Bakar Titingan, this BWI is subject to Directive 1 of the National Disaster Management Agency (Nadma) where only flood victims who were moved to the Temporary Evacuation Center (PPS) are eligible for the assistance.

“I understand that the State Government also provides assistance to flood victims who were not moved to the PPS but the assistance is channeled in the form of food supplies channeled through the Community Welfare Department (JKM),” he said in his statement here.

Rasinin, who is also a former Liawan State Assemblyman, believes that if the State’s financial position is strong as often claimed by Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) leaders, then the State Government actually has no problem in establishing a financial assistance system for Sabah flood victims as a whole.

“We have been told that the State Government will record an income of RM7 billion this year, so there is no problem if the GRS Government provides assistance of at least RM1,000 once a year for Sabah flood victims who are not moved to PPS but have suffered damage to property such as electrical appliances and daily clothes to the workplace.

“The State Government also needs to be responsible for the management of the drainage system, river irrigation and large-scale hill cleaning activities which contribute to the frequency of flood episodes in the state, especially when Sabah is now being hit by global climate change which has caused the amount of rain to fall higher and more frequently,” he said.

He also received a lot of feedback from residents in the Keningau parliamentary housing area who blamed clogged and unmaintained drains as the main cause of the recent floods in Keningau.

Rasinin asked the state government to disclose to Keningau residents, especially those living in residential areas, the names of the companies that were given contracts to maintain the drains in their respective areas.

“I fully support the suggestion made by Warisan Deputy President, Darell Leiking who has requested that the State Government disclose the names of the companies that were given contracts to maintain the drains in the Putatan, Penampang, Kota Kinabalu and Sepangar districts,” he said.

At the same time, Rasinin said it was very sad when GRS leaders were satisfied with the flood assistance from the Federal Government of only RM14 million.

Compared to Kelantan and Terengganu, he said, the Federal Government had provided flood assistance of RM50 million to both states with RM25 million each and another additional assistance of RM50 million to these two states (also RM25 million each) in December last year.

“Since that Sabah is the main contributor to Petronas’ ability to pay dividends of up to RM50 billion a year to the Federal government, the State Government also needs to be firm and courageous in providing financial assistance from the Federal government to repair infrastructure damaged by natural disasters,” he said.",1.74561E+12,en,-0.074768581,2025-04-25 03:00:51,"['minister', 'deputy', 'time', 'flood', 'meeting', 'hit', 'supply', 'dividend', 'resident', 'assembly', 'hill', 'amount', 'disaster', 'understand', 'provided', 'whole', 'provides', 'leiking', 'frequently', 'clothes', 'parliamentary', 'episode', 'sad', 'center', 'directive', 'strong', 'grs', 'rasinin', 'damage', 'drainage', 'another', 'firm', 'largescale', 'last', 'keningau', 'food', 'penampang', 'fully', 'daily', 'year', 'change', 'often', 'establishing', 'infrastructure', 'irrigation', 'leader', 'assistant', 'warisan', 'feedback', 'darell', 'clogged', 'advertisement', 'respective', 'river', 'abu', 'blamed', 'belief', 'kota', 'pay', 'living', 'kautis', 'also', 'responsible', 'caused', 'additional', 'since', 'area', 'kinabalu', 'management', 'contribute', 'housing', 'jkm', 'especially', 'temporary', 'state', 'bantuan', 'unmaintained', 'form', 'rakyat', 'sepangar', 'referring', 'fall', 'issue', 'providing', 'two', 'legislative', 'maintain', 'position', 'sponsored', 'residential', 'evacuation', 'assistance', 'december', 'natural', 'drain', 'contract', 'parti', 'least', 'district', 'record', 'name', 'damaged', 'eligible', 'statement', 'income', 'kelantan', 'agency', 'federal', 'nadma', 'financial', 'support', 'disclose', 'million', 'global', 'requested', 'electrical', 'cleaning', 'putatan', 'need', 'higher', 'create', 'ability', 'given', 'subject', 'activity', 'nizam', 'lot', 'victim', 'claimed', 'asked', 'climate', 'week', 'national', 'company', 'appliance', 'gabungan', 'main', 'made', 'welfare', 'titingan', 'community', 'former', 'rain', 'terengganu', 'bwi', 'according', 'discussed', 'received', 'recent', 'bakar', 'ihsan', 'compared', 'system', 'give', 'repair', 'cause', 'government', 'pps', 'content', 'moved', 'suffered', 'aid', 'property', 'problem', 'sabah', 'wang', 'liawan', 'chief', 'courageous', 'department', 'frequency', 'division', 'said', 'president', 'satisfied', 'contributor', 'workplace', 'channeled', 'petronas', 'billion', 'urged', 'suggestion', 'assemblyman', 'told', 'actually']",Neutral

In a statement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Ewon has also signed the Book of Condolences at the Apostolic Nunciature in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday, on behalf of the Malaysian government.

“Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim has expressed his condolences, honouring Pope Francis’s legacy in promoting interfaith understanding, protecting the environment, and standing up for the marginalised,” it said.

The funeral, held in Vatican City, will feature a solemn Mass at St Peter’s Square led by the Dean of the College of Cardinals.

This will be followed by a ceremonial procession and private interment at the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome.

Pope Francis, who died earlier this month, was the first pontiff from the Americas and the Southern Hemisphere, and led the Catholic Church from 2013 until his death.

He was widely regarded as a reformist figure who sought to modernise the Church’s role in global affairs and improve relations with other faiths.

His papacy was also marked by strong advocacy on climate change, economic inequality, and humanitarian causes.

By Zufazlin Baharuddin KUALA LUMPUR, April 25 (Bernama) -- Zero or reduced reciprocal tariffs for Malaysia could emerge as one of the key positive outcomes from the discussions by Investment, Trade and Industry Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz with the United States Trade Representative (USTR), Jamieson Greer, yesterday. Economist Professor Dr Geoffrey Williams said the recent 90-day pause presents a window of opportunity for Malaysia to negotiate better trade terms, potentially boosting the country’s global trade competitiveness.

bootstrap slideshow “The executive order signed by US President Donald Trump on Liberation Day explicitly allows for negotiations that could lead to the reduction or removal of the reciprocal tariffs, and this is what the US has been promising and promoting. “If the outcome is successful and a commitment to reduce or remove both tariffs and non-tariff barriers is achieved, then the reciprocal tariffs can be lifted or reduced,” he told Bernama. Bank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd chief economist Dr Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid also sees the possibility of securing an exemption or lower tariff following the talks, as Malaysia continues its diplomatic efforts on the matter.

“Given that the current reciprocal tariff is 24 per cent, while Malaysia’s average tariff based on World Trade Organisation (WTO) data is 5.6 per cent, we might reach a compromise in between – or potentially receive exemptions,” he said. He noted that Malaysia remains committed to fair bilateral trade with the US and is keen to see the trade balance between the two countries move towards a more favourable trajectory. On April 2, 2025, the US President announced a series of reciprocal tariffs affecting multiple countries, including a 24 per cent tariff on Malaysian goods, which is currently on pause.",1.74561E+12,en,0.438435406,2025-04-25 10:43:19,"['lead', 'per', 'minister', 'following', 'average', 'donald', 'removal', 'jamieson', 'organisation', 'baharuddin', 'including', 'bank', 'central', 'window', 'securing', 'greer', 'present', 'rashid', 'trade', 'seri', 'nontariff', 'move', 'slideshow', 'mohd', 'cent', 'committed', 'matter', 'representative', 'lumpur', 'investment', 'pause', 'series', 'world', 'term', 'negotiation', 'current', 'malaysian', 'could', 'trump', 'opportunity', 'also', 'based', 'good', 'key', 'continues', 'emerge', 'remains', 'trajectory', 'barrier', 'favourable', 'one', 'united', 'state', 'talk', 'commitment', 'achieved', 'datuk', 'might', 'positive', 'aziz', 'announced', 'boosting', 'geoffrey', 'williams', 'abdul', 'discussion', 'possibility', 'two', 'allows', 'fair', 'reduced', 'news', 'professor', 'see', 'zafrul', 'lower', 'diplomatic', 'tariff', 'noted', 'effort', 'exemption', 'region', 'zufazlin', 'promising', 'bhd', 'global', 'affecting', 'bernama', 'country', 'successful', 'reduction', 'economist', 'given', 'ustr', 'liberation', 'order', 'multiple', 'remove', 'executive', 'potentially', 'bootstrap', 'wto', 'receive', 'recent', 'towards', 'zero', 'kuala', 'competitiveness', 'balance', 'yesterday', 'lifted', 'reciprocal', 'reduce', 'muamalat', 'day', 'compromise', 'negotiate', 'outcome', 'afzanizam', 'explicitly', 'chief', 'reach', 'data', 'april', 'industry', 'malaysia', 'said', 'president', 'bilateral', 'currently', 'signed', 'told', 'tengku', 'keen', 'better', 'promoting']",Neutral

According to the ministry, this instruction, which falls under the MRB’s Licensing and Permit Regulations 2014, is intended to maintain product quality standards and prevent Malaysia from becoming a destination for trade diversion from other countries.

“This measure is taken to ensure product quality and the sustainability of the nation’s rubber glove industry,” the ministry said in a statement.

The move comes amid escalating trade tensions globally, particularly between the US and China.

The US announced far-reaching tariffs on several dozen trade partners on April 2, including Malaysia, which will face a 24% levy. A week later, a 90-day pause on these tariffs was announced for affected countries to negotiate the rates with the US, while a blanket 10% tariff was put in place in the interim — with the exception of China, which was hit with a steep 125% tariff increase on top of an existing 20% rate. In response, China on April 12 slapped a similar rate of tariff on US exports.

The situation has the potential to cause an increase in rubber glove imports to Malaysia that can undermine the competitiveness of the domestic rubber industry, the ministry said in its statement.

To safeguard Malaysia's reputation as a primary source of high-quality rubber products, MRB is collaborating with enforcement agencies to conduct a comprehensive operation aimed at strengthening monitoring and enforcement across the sector, it said.

Malaysia remains a leading global producer and exporter of rubber and rubber-based products, with export values reaching RM33.7 billion in 2024. The rubber glove sector alone contributed RM15.41 billion, or 45.8% of the total, according to the ministry.",1.74561E+12,en,-0.168702334,2025-04-25 11:04:28,"['later', 'hit', 'glove', 'collaborating', 'dozen', 'sector', 'across', 'china', 'sustainability', 'including', 'particularly', 'exporter', 'comprehensive', 'import', 'rubberbased', 'exception', 'export', 'diversion', 'rubber', 'trade', 'contributed', 'move', 'slapped', 'existing', 'safeguard', 'board', 'globally', 'friday', 'face', 'licensed', 'permitted', 'lumpur', 'pause', 'undermine', 'domestic', 'mrb', 'source', 'taken', 'aimed', 'value', 'levy', 'highquality', 'reaching', 'strengthening', 'malaysian', 'intended', 'come', 'escalating', 'increase', 'primary', 'monitoring', 'immediate', 'remains', 'plantation', 'similar', 'alone', 'potential', 'response', 'ministry', 'prevent', 'instruction', 'place', 'enforcement', 'farreaching', 'announced', 'fall', 'maintain', 'mrbs', 'situation', 'standard', 'tension', 'product', 'statement', 'tariff', 'agency', 'permit', 'commodity', 'interim', 'nation', 'leading', 'measure', 'global', 'manufacturing', 'country', 'becoming', 'blanket', 'amid', 'ensure', 'sourced', 'effect', 'reputation', 'week', 'company', 'exporting', 'facility', 'licensing', 'total', 'according', 'regulation', 'partner', 'kuala', 'competitiveness', 'cause', 'rate', 'steep', 'day', 'operation', 'negotiate', 'local', 'top', 'put', 'affected', 'conduct', 'april', 'industry', 'several', 'malaysia', 'producer', 'said', 'billion', 'quality', 'destination']",Neutral

As the Minister of Rural and Regional Development, Ahmad Zahid said that he had instructed MARA chairman Datuk Dr Asyraf Wajdi Dusuki to ensure that Orang Asli students are awarded 100 per cent scholarships to continue their studies at IPMA institutions.

“This initiative reflects the commitment of the MADANI Government, led by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim. I am playing my part in translating this commitment into action for the benefit of the entire community,” he said at the Santuni Kasih Syawal held at Kampung Orang Asli Sungai Kroh earlier today as reported by Bernama.

Also present were Deputy Speaker of the Dewan Rakyat Datuk Ramli Mohd Nor, Asyraf Wajdi, and state Rural Development, Plantation, Agriculture and Food Industry Committee chairman Datuk Mohd Zolkafly Harun.

More than 1,000 Orang Asli community members from across Perak attended the event.

For Orang Asli students who obtained 5As and below in the SPM, they will also be given the opportunity to further their studies at any educational institution under MARA.

In 2024, a total of 1,932 Orang Asli students sat for the SPM examination across Peninsular Malaysia. Of that number, 87 students achieved excellent results with 5As and above, including two who scored 9As, 13 with 8As, 11 with 7As, 22 with 6As, and 39 with 5As.

Meanwhile, Ahmad Zahid, who is also the National Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Committee chairman, said that a dedicated TVET pathway has been established specifically for Orang Asli students. This initiative, he explained, aims to ensure their inclusion in the country’s skilled workforce and support their long-term development. – April 25, 2025",1.74567E+12,en,0.590019226,2025-04-25 06:59:00,"['per', 'deputy', 'minister', 'peninsular', 'across', 'awarded', 'examination', 'pelajaran', 'ibrahim', 'including', 'sat', 'securing', 'scored', 'continue', 'kampung', 'present', 'seri', 'sijil', 'cent', 'mohd', 'instructed', 'agriculture', 'inclusion', 'orang', 'guaranteed', 'kroh', 'amanah', 'educational', 'dedicated', 'sungai', 'food', 'member', 'held', 'madani', 'pathway', 'number', 'event', 'committee', 'excellent', 'asyraf', 'opportunity', 'admission', 'also', 'tvet', 'harun', 'dewan', 'workforce', 'translating', 'regional', 'ipma', 'student', 'ramli', 'plantation', 'today', 'benefit', 'state', 'explained', 'earlier', 'zahid', 'commitment', 'achieved', 'mara', 'datuk', 'rakyat', 'meanwhile', 'wajdi', 'chairman', 'two', 'led', 'speaker', 'asli', 'entire', 'vocational', 'ahmad', 'kasih', 'support', 'specifically', 'achieve', 'development', 'education', 'zolkafly', 'result', 'perak', 'bernama', 'country', 'action', 'technical', 'attended', 'given', 'playing', 'ensure', 'hamidi', 'reported', 'national', 'skilled', 'longterm', 'community', 'majlis', 'scholarship', 'total', 'dusuki', 'outstanding', 'institution', 'study', 'aim', 'part', 'government', 'anwar', 'initiative', 'reflects', 'rural', 'industry', 'obtained', 'april', 'malaysia', 'said', 'training', 'established', 'prime', 'santuni', 'syawal', 'spm']",Positive

The harvest marks a significant milestone for this innovative educational initiative, which integrates STEM with modern agricultural practices.

Launched on February 26, the project involved the cultivation of 200 golden melon plants at the school’s mini farm, under the guidance of Ts Dr Shiamala Devi Ramaiya, Senior Lecturer at the Faculty of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia Bintulu Campus (UPMKB).

Far more than just a co-curricular activity, the project served as a hands-on learning experience that bridged classroom theory with real-world application.

“This harvest symbolises not only the students’ success in agriculture but also their understanding of scientific knowledge and entrepreneurial skills,” said Dr Shiamala.

Throughout the programme, pupils were exposed to the complete planting process – from media measurement, nutrient management, and soil pH control to manual pollination and the creation of melon-based products such as ice cream and pudding.

This achievement was made possible through the strong support of the school and local community.

The presence of parents and residents during harvest day boosted students’ morale and sparked wider interest in agriculture as a part of daily life.

Headmaster of SK Kampung Baru, Mohamed Khaidir Mohamed Arebi, described AgriSTEM as a transformative programme that has reshaped the way pupils engage with learning.

“This experience adds value to their education – not just understanding concepts but seeing tangible results,” he said.

He also expressed hope that AgriSTEM would be expanded further, with a second planting cycle expected to begin soon as a continuation of the learning journey.

Meanwhile, Chairman of the SK Kampung Baru Parent-Teacher Association (PTA), Sikong Lusek, voiced full support for the initiative, viewing it as an excellent platform to nurture students who are not only STEM-literate but also poised to become future leaders in the agrotechnology industry.

KOTA BHARU, April 21 (Bernama) -- The floods that hit Malaysia in 2024 caused losses of RM933.4 million, according to data released by the Department of Statistics Malaysia. Fire and Rescue Department director-general Datuk Nor Hisham Mohammad also said that Kelantan recorded the highest loss among states, at RM139 million in terms of residential property damage, including RM46.2 million in Pasir Mas, RM31.7 million in Tumpat and RM19.2 million in Kota Bharu - the three most affected districts in the state. “These major losses highlight the importance of effective disaster management strategies and mitigation efforts at the state level.

“This data must be thoroughly analysed by the Kelantan Fire and Rescue Department to enable more effective planning, including manpower deployment, asset readiness, and suitable emergency response plans,” he said at the Kelantan JBPM Fire Service Medal, Excellent Service Award, and 30-Year Service Certificate presentation ceremony here today. He also said that the department had heightened its readiness throughout the country following a shift in weather patterns that is expected to bring heavy, localised rain in the afternoons that increased the risk of flash floods. Also, all fire stations and personnel across the country have been instructed to remain on standby following flash flood incidents last week in six districts, including areas in Selangor, Johor, and Sabah, Nor Hisham said.

“We have issued early warnings to all firefighting teams on the ground to be better prepared, especially in high-risk areas. “Flash floods tend to have a greater impact compared to monsoon floods because they happen suddenly and leave little time for residents to prepare,” he noted. -- BERNAMA",1.74527E+12,en,-0.293523431,2025-04-21 09:29:59,"['time', 'flood', 'following', 'hit', 'mitigation', 'across', 'bharu', 'early', 'afternoon', 'heightened', 'resident', 'including', 'disaster', 'pasir', 'emergency', 'station', 'readiness', 'instructed', 'manpower', 'expected', 'warning', 'damage', 'hisham', 'plan', 'pattern', 'last', 'medal', 'highest', 'throughout', 'year', 'bring', 'team', 'directorgeneral', 'term', 'must', 'three', 'weather', 'kota', 'excellent', 'standby', 'also', 'tumpat', 'caused', 'analysed', 'area', 'management', 'greater', 'ceremony', 'especially', 'major', 'asset', 'today', 'response', 'state', 'incident', 'loss', 'datuk', 'personnel', 'impact', 'award', 'increased', 'selangor', 'highlight', 'residential', 'prepare', 'jbpm', 'prepared', 'certificate', 'firefighting', 'district', 'rescue', 'among', 'kelantan', 'effective', 'suitable', 'mohammad', 'deployment', 'noted', 'released', 'effort', 'planning', 'happen', 'million', 'leave', 'little', 'service', 'bernama', 'tend', 'country', 'six', 'presentation', 'enable', 'heavy', 'suddenly', 'strategy', 'week', 'localised', 'ground', 'fire', 'thoroughly', 'rain', 'remain', 'according', 'compared', 'recorded', 'issued', 'highrisk', 'property', 'importance', 'monsoon', 'sabah', 'affected', 'flash', 'data', 'april', 'department', 'malaysia', 'said', 'level', 'general', 'risk', 'johor', 'shift', 'statistic', 'better']",Neutral

JAKARTA : Indonesia is prioritising its national interests in its ongoing negotiations over US tariffs, its senior economic minister and top negotiator said today, as it wants a “fair and square” trade relationship with the US.

Airlangga Hartarto, the head of delegation, and finance minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati have been in the US since last week negotiating the proposed 32% tariffs the US wants to impose on Indonesia.

These tariffs have been put on hold for 90 days.

“In the negotiation process, Indonesia prioritises national interests while encouraging the strengthening of bilateral relations with US,” he said at an online press conference.

Last year, Indonesia reported a US$14.3 billion trade surplus with the US.

The minister refrained from sharing specific details about the negotiations but said that the discussions included energy supply, US market access for Indonesian goods, deregulation in Indonesia, and critical mineral and technology sharing for agriculture, healthcare and renewable sectors.

The two countries also discussed Indonesia’s national payment system and QR code standards, which the US has stated is a barrier for its payments companies.

Airlangga indicated that Indonesia is open to foreign operators such as US firms Visa and Mastercard.

A two-week timeline has been set for discussing technical details.

Indonesia has proposed increasing its imports from the US by up to US$19 billion by switching to US suppliers for goods such as wheat, soybean, liquefied petroleum gas and crude.

Jakarta has also offered to reduce non-tariff barriers and proposed some tax cuts for US goods.

“Such a proposal would not be a “zero sum game” for other trade partners,” Airlangga said, promising Indonesia would look to buy other products from countries affected.

Indonesia hopes its swift decision to negotiate, instead of retaliate, will be rewarded by President Donald Trump.

“Its delegation has been told that while Trump remained the final decision maker, he could favour ‘first movers’,” Sri Mulyani said.

Sri Mulyani said she “compared notes” with other countries hit by hefty US tariffs about their negotiations, while on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank spring meetings this week.

She added that Washington has asked members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) about their response as a bloc to US trade policy.

The Indonesian delegation has met with top US officials and business people in sectors such as semiconductors, as well as executives from companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Boeing.

Yesterday, Sri Mulyani warned that US tariffs and their impact on global economic growth could hurt Indonesia’s economic expansion.

However, she expects a steady 5% growth this year, only slightly below the government’s 5.2% target.",1.74567E+12,en,-0.040868193,2025-04-25 06:42:20,"['crude', 'minister', 'washington', 'online', 'meeting', 'hit', 'asean', 'indonesian', 'mastercard', 'donald', 'supply', 'cut', 'sector', 'critical', 'indicated', 'head', 'google', 'prioritises', 'policy', 'epa', 'bank', 'instead', 'import', 'southeast', 'twoweek', 'negotiator', 'prioritising', 'operator', 'imf', 'market', 'trade', 'gas', 'nontariff', 'surplus', 'specific', 'agriculture', 'decision', 'conference', 'energy', 'square', 'firm', 'healthcare', 'mover', 'hefty', 'steady', 'refrained', 'mulyani', 'look', 'last', 'proposed', 'sideline', 'indrawati', 'world', 'year', 'note', 'included', 'added', 'hope', 'negotiation', 'swift', 'switching', 'member', 'strengthening', 'proposal', 'could', 'trump', 'senior', 'retaliate', 'like', 'economic', 'also', 'since', 'deregulation', 'negotiating', 'increasing', 'good', 'sharing', 'spring', 'buy', 'official', 'remained', 'discussing', 'rewarded', 'final', 'favour', 'barrier', 'encouraging', 'business', 'today', 'renewable', 'response', 'hurt', 'association', 'mineral', 'target', 'impose', 'set', 'microsoft', 'impact', 'expects', 'met', 'expansion', 'sum', 'hold', 'offered', 'technology', 'detail', 'discussion', 'two', 'open', 'well', 'fair', 'warned', 'game', 'however', 'standard', 'relationship', 'payment', 'product', 'tariff', 'nation', 'timeline', 'airlangga', 'promising', 'global', 'tax', 'visa', 'first', 'country', 'semiconductor', 'wheat', 'soybean', 'jakarta', 'access', 'technical', 'pic', 'amazon', 'petroleum', 'people', 'reported', 'asked', 'executive', 'week', 'national', 'company', 'stated', 'growth', 'interest', 'slightly', 'would', 'finance', 'maker', 'discussed', 'compared', 'partner', 'asian', 'boeing', 'system', 'zero', 'want', 'yesterday', 'government', 'relation', 'reduce', 'bloc', 'day', 'ongoing', 'foreign', 'negotiate', 'top', 'put', 'sri', 'supplier', 'affected', 'indonesia', 'delegation', 'said', 'bilateral', 'president', 'image', 'billion', 'process', 'liquefied', 'told', 'hartarto', 'press', 'code']",Neutral

The tour was aimed at promoting youth participation in agriculture, particularly the coffee value chain.

The Omukama was received by Inspire Africa Coffee Group CEO Nelson Tugume, whose enterprise has earned wide acclaim for championing value addition and innovation in Uganda’s coffee industry.

Tugume described the royal visit as a strong endorsement of youth-led agricultural entrepreneurship and an opportunity to amplify conversations about sustainable livelihoods through agribusiness.

“To have His Majesty, who himself is a passionate advocate for youth empowerment, tour our facility is a great honour and a boost to our vision.”

The King encouraged people in Tooro Kingdom and beyond to put more efforts in growing Coffee to boost house hold incomes. He thanked the Management of Inspire Coffee, the Leadership of Ntungamo District and Farmers of Ntungamo District for the warm hospitality.

The Inspire Africa Coffee factory, known for its cutting-edge technology and commitment to quality, took King Oyo through the entire coffee processing chain—from bean sorting to final packaging.

The factory has previously attracted national attention, with past visitors including President Museveni, First Lady Janet Museveni, the Leader of Opposition in Parliament, and various parliamentary committees.

King Oyo’s visit comes as preparations peak for the upcoming Inspire Africa Coffee Marathon, scheduled for 24 May 2025.

The event will feature Tanzanian star Diamond Platnumz and Uganda’s own athlete Docus Inzikuru, further bridging agriculture, sport, and entertainment in a bid to inspire youth.

The Tooro monarch, who has long supported youth and agricultural initiatives, used his visit to rally more of his kingdom’s subjects—especially the young—to embrace coffee farming and value addition.

KOTA BHARU, April 21 (Bernama) -- The Sultan of Kelantan, Sultan Muhammad V, has expressed deep concern regarding security issues along the Malaysia-Thailand border. In light of this, he emphasised the urgent need to finalise the proposal for constructing a wall and establishing a buffer zone in the Sungai Golok area without delay. Sultan Muhammad V said this in his royal address when opening the Third Term of the 15th Kelantan State Legislative Assembly today.

He also stressed the urgent need for a swift resolution to the recurring flood issues in the state. “I urge that the integrated river basin projects for Sungai Kelantan and Sungai Golok be expedited in all its phases,"" he said. ""Priority must be given to the construction of the Lebir Dam, as it is crucial in addressing the flood challenges in Kelantan,"" he added.

Sultan Muhammad V also urged government agencies, departments, and companies involved in the agricultural sector to remain focused on their core responsibilities while intensifying efforts to ensure the state and country’s food security is firmly secured. “I strongly encourage the government and the public to explore and cultivate high-potential crops, such as coconut and durian, as valuable sources of income within the agricultural sector. In line with the Kelantan Agricultural Development Enactment (2022), His Royal Highness urged the immediate development of an agricultural produce collection centre in Lojing to avoid losing key opportunities for revenue, investment, and economic growth.",1.74527E+12,en,0.133947447,2025-04-21 06:10:41,"['flood', 'golok', 'sector', 'bharu', 'assembly', 'integrated', 'involved', 'light', 'crucial', 'security', 'enactment', 'firmly', 'explore', 'muhammad', 'highpotential', 'secured', 'sungai', 'durian', 'investment', 'food', 'avoid', 'source', 'priority', 'establishing', 'within', 'term', 'must', 'urgent', 'added', 'swift', 'responsibility', 'proposal', 'construction', 'finalise', 'constructing', 'river', 'kota', 'opportunity', 'economic', 'lebir', 'also', 'strongly', 'recurring', 'cultivate', 'area', 'key', 'address', 'immediate', 'emphasised', 'regarding', 'royal', 'resolution', 'dam', 'today', 'state', 'border', 'focused', 'issue', 'revenue', 'expedited', 'legislative', 'challenge', 'sultan', 'without', 'third', 'centre', 'produce', 'deep', 'addressing', 'core', 'income', 'kelantan', 'agency', 'urge', 'development', 'effort', 'bernama', 'malaysiathailand', 'wall', 'need', 'country', 'valuable', 'crop', 'given', 'ensure', 'losing', 'agricultural', 'phase', 'company', 'highness', 'growth', 'remain', 'concern', 'encourage', 'public', 'government', 'buffer', 'delay', 'collection', 'line', 'april', 'department', 'said', 'coconut', 'project', 'opening', 'intensifying', 'expressed', 'basin', 'along', 'urged', 'lojing', 'stressed', 'zone']",Neutral

This achievement highlights the growing investor confidence in both districts, driven by strategic developments in the manufacturing sector, particularly in renewable energy.

ECERDC aims to position Segamat and Mersing as key food production hubs by attracting investments in agriculture, fisheries, and dairy. This effort supports Johor’s role in Malaysia’s food security agenda. In addition, Mersing is being developed as a gateway for nature-based tourism, with ongoing infrastructure upgrades to enhance accessibility and eco-tourism opportunities.

A significant project for Segamat is the development of an 860MW hybrid solar power plant on a 1,700-acre site, which will be one of the largest renewable energy projects in the region. Aligned with the National Energy Transition Roadmap, the project is a major step in Malaysia’s decarbonisation efforts. Additionally, Segamat will host a biomass facility converting agricultural waste into palm pellet fuel, contributing to the circular economy. YAB Dato’ Onn Hafiz Ghazi, Johor Menteri Besar pictured with ECER. Implementation Coordination Committee (ICC) members during the ICC Johor Meeting on April 24, 2025.

In Mersing, the Jemaluang Dairy Valley (JDV) project is progressing, with 93% of the modern integrated dairy hub complete as of March 2025. The project is expected to strengthen domestic milk production, reduce reliance on imports, and generate new job opportunities once fully operational by June.

Tourism infrastructure projects in both districts are also advancing. Key initiatives include the development of the Peta Rainforest Discovery Centre, road upgrades to Johor Endau-Rompin National Park, and the construction of a new jetty on Pulau Pemanggil. These efforts aim to enhance tourism, create new opportunities, and support economic diversification.

Additional investments in Segamat include a plastic product and packaging facility, an integrated coconut processing mill, and a smart broiler poultry farm using precision farming technology. These projects will contribute to rural-based supply chains and bolster both national food and energy security.

Datuk Onn Hafiz Ghazi, Johor Menteri Besar, expressed confidence that continued collaboration between the State Government, MIDA, and ECERDC will lead to more high-impact investments. This aligns with the ECER Development Roadmap under the 13th Malaysia Plan (RMK-13), which aims for a combined GDP of RM13 billion for Segamat and Mersing by 2030.

Datuk Baidzawi Che Mat, CEO of ECERDC, highlighted the importance of agriculture in driving sustainable development in both districts. The launch of the Inisiatif Pendapatan Rakyat – Program Usahawan Tani (IPR-INTAN) in Segamat and the JDV in Mersing reflects ECERDC’s commitment to strengthening Malaysia’s agro-food ecosystem and empowering rural communities.

Additionally, a strategic partnership has been formed with the Segamat District Office and CSC Plantation Sdn Bhd to implement a 10-year smart fertigation project under the IPR-INTAN programme. This project aims to enhance rural productivity and provide stable income for B40 participants.

Ahmad Zahid’s productive 45-minute meeting with Gibran at the Vice Presidential Palace in Central Jakarta was also attended by Agriculture and Food Security Minister Datuk Seri Mohamad Sabu and Malaysia’s Ambassador to Indonesia Datuk Syed Mohamad Hasrin Tengku Hussin.

Regarding halal matters, the two leaders discussed opportunities for collaboration in the US$1.3 trillion halal sector, as well as challenges that could be tackled jointly. These included the mutual recognition of halal certificates issued by the Department of Islamic Development Malaysia (JAKIM) and the Indonesian Ulema Council.

“We will coordinate and engage in detailed discussions not only regarding the production of halal products but also on marketing strategies,” he said at a press conference after the meeting.

The two countries also agreed to enhance the process of sending workers from Indonesia to Malaysia through the One Channel System and to address the management of fishermen who encroach on territorial waters, as outlined in a memorandum of understanding signed in 2012.

“For Malaysian fishermen who may have inadvertently crossed into Indonesian waters in unresolved territorial areas, they can be safely returned, just as Indonesian fishermen will be,” said Ahmad Zahid.

The discussion also covered bilateral cooperation on regional matters, including addressing the United States’ tariffs and exploring new markets for crude palm oil (CPO) from major producing nations such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.

Ahmad Zahid and Gibran, both deeply concerned about the plight of the Palestinian people, emphasised the importance of pursuing a long-term solution. This includes the reconstruction of Gaza in key areas such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure, as well as advocating for a permanent ceasefire and raising these issues in international forums.

When asked about the status of the proposed bridge between Melaka and Dumai in Riau, Ahmad Zahid said that a feasibility study must first be conducted. This study would assess the return on investment and evaluate the potential for boosting trade, tourism, and mobility between Malaysia and Indonesia, particularly along the strategic Straits of Melaka.

“Before any decisions are made regarding the construction of the bridge, it is essential to consider the technical, economic, social, and environmental aspects,” he explained.

Other topics of discussion included exploring opportunities for collaboration in the ASEAN franchise sector, particularly for young entrepreneurs in both countries. There was also a strong focus on initiatives to empower youth, such as student exchange programmes, social entrepreneurship, and fostering innovation.

(Facebook pic)

PETALING JAYA : The Selangor government will implement 11 immediate flood mitigation measures at flood-prone areas, including Taman Sri Muda, Meru and Taman Seri Alam, says executive councillor Izham Hashim.

The infrastructure and agriculture committee chairman said the decision was reached at a special coordination meeting yesterday among state executive councillors, assemblymen, local authorities and government agencies.

Izham said the state department of irrigation and drainage (DID) presented mid- and long-term plans along with immediate measures to tackle floods in the three areas, Bernama reported.

The plans include maintaining drains that are not officially owned or maintained by any specific party, as well as installing flag gates at Sungai Binjai in Meru to help with flood mitigation measures for Sungai Kapar Kecil and Sungai Kapar Besar.

“Booster pumps at Sungai Binjai will be activated as well,” he said in a statement.

For Taman Sri Muda, the immediate measures taken include upgrading the ageing drainage system to a higher level of protection, at least 20 average recurrence intervals for the entire area, he said.

“The damaged flap gate at Sungai Klang will also be replaced, and the Taman Sri Muda retention pond will be enlarged. Additionally, the soil bunds along the banks of Sungai Klang will be strengthened and upgraded, with new bunds constructed along the banks of Sungai Rasau.

“Other measures include enforcement on trespassing on river land reserves and the shifting of utility cables and pipes that obstruct drains as well as the upgrade of the water control gate automated system,” he said.

Izham said the Selangor DID had presented progress reports on the repair work done for the flood retention pond in Hillpark, Puncak Alam, that broke for the second time, flooding Taman Seri Alam early yesterday morning.

He said property developer Hillpark Resources had suggested several short-term measures at the meeting to tackle the problem, which will be implemented this week.

Izham said he would visit the area to monitor the progress and assess both the immediate and long-term measures agreed to by the parties.

Last Sunday, more than 500 residents from Taman Sri Muda, Bukit Kemuning and Batu Lapan gathered in a peaceful demonstration over the flood problems plaguing their neighbourhoods. They also submitted a memorandum to Selangor menteri besar Amirudin Shari for a permanent solution.

Following the protest, Amirudin said he had asked Izham to immediately identify and implement follow-up action, including engaging with the residents and reviewing the state’s flood mitigation measures.",1.74559E+12,en,-0.064593151,2025-04-24 13:20:05,"['strengthened', 'time', 'flood', 'meeting', 'pond', 'following', 'recurrence', 'average', 'bukit', 'identify', 'mitigation', 'activated', 'early', 'pump', 'work', 'broke', 'kemuning', 'resident', 'including', 'flooding', 'bank', 'say', 'ageing', 'kecil', 'shortterm', 'installing', 'hashim', 'seri', 'include', 'tackle', 'booster', 'kapar', 'gathered', 'agriculture', 'specific', 'decision', 'upgrade', 'demonstration', 'menteri', 'drainage', 'amirudin', 'besar', 'plan', 'shari', 'developer', 'bunds', 'sungai', 'constructed', 'last', 'taken', 'infrastructure', 'suggested', 'upgraded', 'irrigation', 'utility', 'three', 'river', 'committee', 'replaced', 'progress', 'also', 'area', 'meru', 'immediate', 'floodprone', 'automated', 'shifting', 'facebook', 'special', 'klang', 'protection', 'flag', 'upgrading', 'protest', 'reached', 'state', 'interval', 'enforcement', 'engaging', 'petaling', 'control', 'party', 'batu', 'enlarged', 'chairman', 'selangor', 'well', 'flap', 'maintaining', 'memorandum', 'hillpark', 'peaceful', 'muda', 'drain', 'least', 'entire', 'visit', 'agreed', 'damaged', 'statement', 'morning', 'among', 'agency', 'maintained', 'water', 'reviewing', 'binjai', 'jaya', 'neighbourhood', 'presented', 'authority', 'measure', 'lapan', 'bernama', 'taman', 'higher', 'done', 'gate', 'mid', 'rasau', 'trespassing', 'action', 'installed', 'pic', 'alam', 'additionally', 'implemented', 'reported', 'asked', 'executive', 'week', 'report', 'retention', 'help', 'longterm', 'would', 'soil', 'solution', 'second', 'system', 'monitor', 'part', 'repair', 'government', 'yesterday', 'obstruct', 'property', 'immediately', 'puncak', 'followup', 'local', 'problem', 'sri', 'assess', 'officially', 'plaguing', 'department', 'land', 'several', 'said', 'pipe', 'owned', 'level', 'cable', 'councillor', 'sunday', 'submitted', 'along', 'new', 'assemblyman', 'reserve', 'resource', 'implement', 'permanent', 'coordination', 'izham']",Neutral
outbreak,Opinion: Tengku Maimun is in the best position to speak out for judicial independence,1.74558E+12,The Edge Malaysia,theedgemalaysia.com,https://news.google.com/read/CBMiUEFVX3lxTE1SZnk5QVVFWS1yd21aNmpoUFhEQkU3Q1JINWpsQXhDMGR5YXNHckhteTJ5SEhGdGZ5TkNycWdzS2Z4azFxUE1zOHA4LUV2OVBY?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/753036,"(April 25): It is neither controversial nor counter-democratic for the head of the judiciary to defend the judicial institution and seek to strengthen it, which includes giving opinions on institutional reforms to reinforce judicial independence.

Institutionally, the judiciary is the weakest among the three branches, being the most susceptible to encroachments by the other two. Furthermore, it lacks spending power. Nor does the judiciary have the same tools, resources and forum to respond to attacks against it that the other two branches have. In American founding father Alexander Hamilton's words, the judiciary neither controls the ‘purse’ nor the ‘sword’.

This double-barrelled vulnerability leaves the judiciary with no recourse to protect itself, especially when judicial independence is at stake. The 1988 judicial crisis, which led to the removal of the Lord President and two other Supreme Court judges, left an indelible blot in the country’s judicial history. Likewise for the judicial fixing scandal infamously known as the ‘Lingam Tape Scandal’. In both instances, the judiciary was defenceless.

Viewed in these institutional and historical contexts, it demands courageous judicial leadership to voice concerns from within the judiciary. Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat’s recent speech at the Commonwealth Law Conference in Malta advanced her affirmative view, as the Chief Justice, on the proposals to amend the Judicial Appointments Commission Act 2009 (JAC Act 2009) and the Federal Constitution to remove the prime ministerial role in judicial appointments. As many lawyers like Haniff Khatri Abdulla rightly observed, Tengku Maimun’s speech has been blown out of proportion. It merely rehearsed the longstanding arguments for reforming the JAC by the Malaysian Bar, civil society and the legal academia.

Many politicians, including Datuk Seri Mohd Nazri Aziz, have questioned the legitimacy of her role as a judge in making such remarks, especially on constitutional reforms which will alter the balance of powers. In their views, this may amount to an overreaching of the judicial role, as the judges should not interfere with the legislative-making powers of the legislature, and constitutional amendments fall firmly within such powers.

Such views, with due respect, are misplaced. In Malaysia, the Federal Constitution is supreme under Article 4(1), unlike the UK, where the Parliament is supreme. The Malaysian Federal Constitution, structurally, not only empowers the Malaysian judiciary to interpret the Constitution, but also to safeguard the constitutional principles. One of the cardinal principles is judicial independence.

Upon scrutiny, Tengku Maimun’s speech does not, in any sense, usurp the role of the legislature or executive. It is merely a view to buttress judicial independence. Such a view, in light of the institutional history and constitutional context of Malaysia, is measured and justified.

Let’s talk about history

Interpreting historical facts from a different angle is one thing, but distorting or selectively ignoring historical facts and truth is another.

Mahathir Rais has recently asserted that there were inconsistencies in such a call for reform, where ‘bypasses of the JAC process by previous administrations’ were ‘quietly accepted, even celebrated’. Along this vein, he doubted the ‘historical honesty’ of these reform proposals, especially when the judicial members supporting such proposals were appointed through the same processes. This assertion, nonetheless, warrants some detailed clarification and rebuttals.

The bypasses referred to by Rais pertain to the investigation of the Special Task Force (STF) of former attorney general Tommy Thomas’ memoir “My Story: Justice in the Wilderness” regarding the alleged bypassing of JAC recommendations during the administration of Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad from 2018 to 2020. In October 2022, the government declassified the STF report.

The STF report revealed that in June 2018, Mahathir, as the newly elected prime minister, did not adopt any of the JAC’s recommendations submitted by then Chief Justice Mohamed Raus Sharif for appointing three top judges of the upper echelons — the Chief Justice, the President of the Court of Appeal and the Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak — as confirmed by the secretary of the JAC. Instead, the judicial candidates put forward by Mahathir prevailed.

Setting the historical record straight

At first glance, this seemed to suggest executive interference in judicial appointments, as characterised by the report. Nonetheless, this was an oversimplification of facts.

First, in 2017, the tenures of Mohamed Raus and President of the Court of Appeal Zulkefli Ahmad Makinudin were extended through their appointment as ‘additional judges’. This move was controversial as it bypassed the constitutional age limit imposed on them under Article 125(1). The constitutionality of their appointments was legally challenged before the court. Therefore, these naturally cast doubts on the legitimacy of the recommendation by the JAC chaired by Mohamed Raus.

Second, upon further inspection, the JAC’s recommendation on June 13, 2018 may not be legal at all. Five judges and four eminent persons sit on the nine-member JAC. As shown by the JAC’s official website, the positions of four eminent persons were all vacated from Feb 9, 2017 to Sept 3, 2018. It was impossible for the then JAC to achieve the statutorily required quorum to select judicial candidates. A quorum of at least seven members is required for every selection meeting under Section 24(4) of the JAC Act 2009.

Third, this seemed to be only a one-off non-compliance with the JAC’s recommendation during the Mahathir administration from 2018 to 2020. The STF report clearly showed that during the second round of judicial appointments in 2019, he largely followed the institutional procedures prescribed by the JAC Act 2009 in appointing the top three judicial posts – the Chief Justice, the President of the Court of Appeal and the Chief Judge of the High Court in Malaya.

According to the report, it is crystal clear that the current Chief Justice of Malaysia Tengku Maimun was appointed in a procedure which fully complied with the processes prescribed by the JAC Act 2009. This fact was further supported by the revelation of a former JAC member on April 22, 2025, therefore dispelling any misconceived doubts questioning the procedural propriety of her appointment.

More strikingly, the report showed that on April 5, 2019, the JAC, under the leadership of the then Chief Justice of Malaysia Richard Malanjum, managed to thwart Mahathir’s attempt to substitute his candidate in place of the JAC-recommended candidate for the Chief Judge of Malaya. The judicial candidate recommended by the JAC — Azahar Mohamed — ultimately prevailed over his preferred candidate, Abang Iskandar Abang Hashim.

In short, the ‘bypasses of JAC processes’ in 2018 seemed to be a one-off exceptional situation which may have warranted executive input, particularly given the highly politicised and controversial judicial appointments by the previous regime under Datuk Seri Najib Razak. The legality of the JAC’s recommendation in June 2018 was highly questionable, as was the constitutionality of the appointment of the Chief Justice who chaired it.

The current institutional safeguards are inadequate

The historical facts above rebut Rais’ scepticism of the ‘historical honesty’ of judicial leaders calling for reforms. They also highlight the key role played by the judicial leaders in safeguarding judicial independence, particularly Chief Justice-cum-JAC Chairman Richard Malanjum in 2019. At the same time, they expose that the current institutional safeguards are inadequate, as institutional leadership plays a more pivotal role.

The JAC Act 2009 has been far from perfect since its inception. To recall, in 2013, the then prime minister Najib vetoed the JAC’s recommendations on the elevation of Datuk Seri Mohd Hishamudin Yunus to the Federal Court. No explanations were given. The transparency of the executive decision-making in the adoption process of JAC recommendations has always been questioned. These point towards the problematic retention of executive discretion under the JAC Act 2009, which, in turn, paradoxically required another executive intervention in 2018 to restore judicial independence when the then JAC was dysfunctional.

Therefore, as both the Chief Justice and the JAC chairperson, Tengku Maimun’s endorsement of the JAC reforms was timely, given that her tenure is soon ending. It seems logical and plausible to suggest that constitutional guarantees of judicial independence, which are systemically entrenched, are more reliable than transient institutional leadership in practice. The operation of the JAC, which remains largely contingent on institutional practices, should be revamped along this line.

Constitutional context matters

The Constitution is dynamic, not static. Nonetheless, some guiding principles of the Constitution are immutable and unalterable. One of them is judicial independence, as intended by the framers of the Constitution.

Applying Rais’s logic that the Federal Constitution’s Article 122B, which outlines the process for appointing judges, preserves the framers’ intent, which designated the executive role as ‘part of a system of checks and balances’ to hold the judiciary accountable, then one would inevitably question how the constitutional amendment of Article 121(1) in 1988, which purported to remove ‘the judicial power vested into the judiciary’, fits in this picture.

I agree with Rais that any discussion about judicial independence cannot be divorced from the constitutional context. Yet, it is disingenuous to ignore or dilute the importance of the 1988 constitutional amendment, alongside the 1988 judicial crisis, which have fundamentally altered the constitutional landscape and adversely affected judicial independence.

No other constitutional amendment has shifted the constitutional balance of powers as radically as the amendment of Article 121(1) in 1988. The judiciary viewed its judicial power as being ‘watered down’ by such an amendment and therefore deferred extensively to the executive and legislature in its judicial decisions. The 1988 judicial crisis diminished judicial morale. Subsequent judicial scandals further tarnished public perception towards judicial independence.

This is the constitutional context which matters. While we discuss prospective reforms, we should never forget to inspect retrospectively to understand the underlying concerns informing the reform proposals. If a constitutional amendment to Article 122B is required to entrench judicial independence, so be it. The framers’ intent does not require all constitutional provisions to remain intact. Conversely, constitutional amendments may be necessary to give effect to the framers’ intent, especially when the prevailing circumstances — a lopsided balance of powers favouring the executive and legislature — contradict what the framers envisaged.

Contemporary challenges to the judiciary

It took almost 30 years for the judiciary to recover its judicial power and independence by declaring that the amended Article 121(1) did not undermine the judicial power because it remains vested in the judiciary due to constitutional supremacy under Article 4(1) in 2017.

Nonetheless, the judiciary is fraught with myriad challenges. Internally, the eight-month-long gridlock in filling the vacancy of the Chief Judge of Malaya exposes the fragility of the current JAC. Externally, the political mobilisation of fervent supporters protesting against decisions involving prominent political figures (e.g. the SRC case) and cases involving religion (e.g. the Nik Elin case) poses a visible threat to judicial independence.

Hence, with Tengku Maimun’s impending retirement, the Malaysian judiciary is approaching a critical juncture, which could dictate its future development for the next few decades. It is therefore high time, and indeed brave, for her as the judicial leader to step up and echo institutional reforms to bolster judicial independence. By doing so, she is not only defending the judicial institution, but also discharging the obligations under her constitutional oath to ‘preserve, protect and defend’ the Federal Constitution. Without an independent judiciary, the Constitution could not operate effectively.

Moreover, it is neither uncommon nor illegitimate for judicial leaders to issue public statements defending the independence of the judiciary. In February 2025, the Lady Chief Justice — the Head of the Judiciary of England and Wales — Baroness Sue Carr, publicly expressed her disapproval towards both Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the Leader of the Opposition’s inaccurate framing of an immigration law case. In reminding the government and the Parliament to respect judicial independence, she remarked, ""it is really dangerous to make any criticism of a judgement without a full understanding of the facts and the law.""

Similarly, it is indeed dangerous to criticise Tengku Maimun’s speech without reading it in its entirety and fully understanding the constitutional, institutional and historical context surrounding her speech. In this era of political fragmentation, with the rampant rise of populism, facts and truth, unfortunately, are often deliberately ignored or distorted to serve the political rhetoric of certain quarters or for political expediency. Nevertheless, both lady chief justices in Malaysia and England and Wales remain steadfast and unwavering in defending the judiciary, serving as the constitutional bulwark of judicial independence. This, at least, provides us with a beacon of hope.",1.74569E+12,en,-0.421942383,2025-04-25 11:41:00,"['certain', 'minister', 'supporting', 'tape', 'declaring', 'era', 'highly', 'unalterable',

KUALA SELANGOR : The residents of Taman Seri Alam are demanding a resolution of the issues involving the nearby retention pond, a section of which collapsed yet again yesterday causing floods in parts of the residential area.

Sazalie Basran.

Sazalie Basran, chairman of the Taman Seri Alam residents’ association, said they would continue to live in fear, especially during the rainy season, unless these issues were resolved.

“Don’t act only after tragedy strikes,” he told FMT.

Selangor fire and rescue department director Wan Razali Wan Ismail said yesterday that the embankment breach was believed to have occurred at around 5.30am after overnight rain.

Residents had put up a banner expressing their displeasure with the repeated collapse of the retention pond.

Some 35 homes were inundated in the back, with water levels reaching an estimated 0.2 feet.

Several videos which went viral on social media captured the extent of the flood, showing submerged streets and water levels rising to the height of vehicle tyres.

Many residents scrambled to move their cars to higher ground in an attempt to protect them from the rising floodwaters.

The incident followed a similar event last December, when a section of the same retention pond collapsed and caused flooding in the residential area. Another incident was also reported a decade ago.

Sazalie claimed that the structure of the retention pond was unsafe, as the base was not only higher than the homes in the neighbourhood, but also had a rubber wall.

“It’s like we are living next to a dam which could break at any time. We want this retention pond to be sealed,” he said, adding that there had been talk about increasing the size of the retention pond.

Akmal Abdul Ghani.

Resident Akmal Abdul Ghani said he began feeling unsafe after the retention pond was built in front of his house in 2015.

The 39-year-old, who has lived in the area since 2011, said he could no longer cope with the losses incurred due to the flooding.

He said last night’s incident alone had caused an estimated RM2,000 in damage.

“It (the flooding) happened very quickly. My wife and I only managed to salvage the electrical goods.

“We couldn’t do anything about the furniture. Fortunately, the water receded swiftly,” the father of five said.",1.7455E+12,en,-0.702600181,2025-04-24 03:28:32,"['unless', 'time', 'flood', 'pond', 'nearby', 'resident', 'cope', 'flooding', 'lived', 'video', 'quickly', 'overnight', 'continue', 'rubber', 'break', 'front', 'around', 'yet', 'feeling', 'season', 'decade', 'receded', 'seri', 'captured', 'move', 'ago', 'demanding', 'happened', 'dont', 'social', 'inundated', 'fmt', 'damage', 'another', 'act', 'father', 'strike', 'rainy', 'last', 'director', 'floodwaters', 'scrambled', 'collapse', 'tyre', 'live', 'longer', 'reaching', 'height', 'began', 'akmal', 'fortunately', 'event', 'could', 'razali', 'living', 'protect', 'street', 'also', 'caused', 'since', 'increasing', 'area', 'good', 'went', 'overflowing', 'anything', 'especially', 'extent', 'embankment', 'occurred', 'similar', 'resolution', 'alone', 'dam', 'banner', 'showing', 'medium', 'incident', 'association', 'fear', 'rising', 'talk', 'loss', 'estimated', 'issue', 'sealed', 'chairman', 'selangor', 'abdul', 'yearold', 'residential', 'foot', 'night', 'expressing', 'december', 'furniture', 'rescue', 'base', 'water', 'causing', 'resolved', 'wife', 'house', 'neighbourhood', 'car', 'electrical', 'taman', 'wall', 'higher', 'adding', 'unsafe', 'couldnt', 'tragedy', 'ghani', 'alam', 'swiftly', 'reported', 'claimed', 'involving', 'retention', 'ground', 'section', 'five', 'fire', 'incurred', 'size', 'would', 'rain', 'viral', 'breach', 'attempt', 'built', 'sazalie', 'believed', 'collapsed', 'kuala', 'part', 'yesterday', 'want', 'managed', 'followed', 'vehicle', 'home', 'next', 'put', 'basran', 'due', 'back', 'wan', 'several', 'department', 'repeated', 'said', 'submerged', 'many', 'level', 'structure', 'displeasure', 'salvage', 'ismail', 'told', 'like']",Negative

(Bernama pic)

PETALING JAYA : Health minister Dzulkefly Ahmad says he is concerned about the declining interest in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics stream and its impact on the supply of medical students.

Dzulkefly today said that despite more than 14,000 students securing straight A’s at the 2024 SPM examination, there has been a noticeable decline in interest in the science stream.

“This is a cause for concern as medical majors are from the science stream,” he said according to Bernama.

“I hope that we can reignite interest among these 14,000 students. This is crucial to ensure that the health ministry’s human resource challenges are effectively addressed,” he said in Kota Bharu.

He also urged the education ministry and the science, technology and innovation ministry to motivate and encourage students to choose the science stream.

PETALING JAYA : The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission has arrested a superintendent of police as part of its investigation into alleged false claims involving a maintenance contract for a RM70 million police command and control system.

Sinar Harian quoted a source from the MACC as saying that the superintendent was arrested to assist in investigations related to payments made by contractors and subcontractors for the maintenance contract.

The source said that the officer’s home and office were also searched. A remand application is expected to be filed tomorrow.

The source also revealed that statements have been recorded from 15 witnesses and detainees. To date, a total of RM7.6 million has been frozen in connection with the case.

MACC’s senior director of special operations, Zamri Zainul Abidin, confirmed the arrest.

Yesterday, six people, including a company director, a chief financial officer and two police officers, were remanded for allegedly submitting false claims totalling RM15 million between 2022 and 2025.

According to a source from the anti-graft agency, parts of the support services outlined in the maintenance contract were not properly executed.

The MACC raided 15 locations across Johor, Selangor, Putrajaya, and Kuala Lumpur, including ministry offices and company premises.

PETALING JAYA : The nine pig farms in the Ayer Kuning state constituency are in full compliance with waste disposal regulations and are not causing river pollution, says agriculture and food security minister Mohamad Sabu.

He said the Perak department of veterinary services (DVS) conducted a study which confirmed that the farm waste is first discharged into a pond, where it is decontaminated using scientifically approved methods, before being released into the river.

“The reading of pollutants discharged into the river is below 10 ppm (parts per million), which is within safe levels.

outbreak,Hybrid in transition: Shaping Malaysia’s electrified future,1.74562E+12,The Star,www.thestar.com.my,https://news.google.com/read/CBMisgFBVV95cUxPOHlQZWEwVV9QSk9DUUlhakxnQzJweEJJMkJjWDZtd2o4UmxkRzY2Tk85N2tHcnRqVnFXb1gtR1kySktkUUtBS2dCVjJZbXdldGY0eTl3Q24wM2VPRTBkTDJCd1RFbDZnM0FlS0VWVUJqUDlPZGRVUm11NThQc24wUnoxMmIyVlVXS2dJUS0xd0gySkRnb041WjJxZklURk1XSE12Nzhkbmk5Y0M5RWhueHhR?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://www.thestar.com.my/business/insight/2025/04/26/hybrid-in-transition-shaping-malaysias-electrified-future,"Change, especially when it comes in big doses, makes people uneasy. We’re creatures of habit. We stick to what we know – especially in the parts of life that define our daily rhythm: work, finances, lifestyle...and the cars we drive.

The automobile industry is no exception. Despite leaps in technology – cars that can park themselves or drive autonomously –we’re still rolling on four rubber tyres, filling up with petrol, and navigating the same old traffic jams. But underneath the hood, a quieter revolution is unfolding.

Globally, automakers are rethinking electrification. Not just through battery electric vehicles (BEVs), but with hybrids (HEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs).

The pendulum is swinging back from all-in BEV ambitions to more inclusive, flexible strategies. Less revolution, more evolution, innovation, pragmatism.

And in Malaysia, this middle road may be the key.

Environmental awareness isn’t new, climate change has been part of the public discourse since the 1980s. Yet, despite that, car usage has surged.

In 1985, Malaysia had around 4 million active vehicles. Today, it’s 23 million – almost six times growth, while the population has just doubled, car dependency is deeply entrenched, urban sprawl continues. Public transport is improving, but not fast enough.

And while most Malaysians care about the environment, the daily realities of commuting override green intentions.

So the question becomes: what can we do now, while laying the tracks for a cleaner future?

Hybrids may be the answer hiding in plain sight.

A hybrid uses both a combustion engine and an electric motor, either working together or separately to power the vehicle. Unlike mild hybrids, which only assist the engine, hybrids can drive short distances on electric power alone.

The battery recharges itself via regenerative braking and the engine – no plugging in required. In traffic jams, during idling, and in stop-go city driving, hybrids operate more efficiently than conventional vehicles, offering fuel savings of 30% to 50% and cutting tailpipe emissions without changing driver behaviour.

The first wave of hybrids arrived in Malaysia in 2009. Toyota and Honda led the charge, supported by government policies. Early adopters were intrigued, but the scale remained limited.

Today, hybrids account for roughly 4% of total vehicle sales – about 30,000 units annually, BEVs are half that. These figures are promising, they signal change. And hybrids, with their lower barriers to entry, are better positioned to scale now.

1. Hybrids deliver climate benefits immediately.

They don’t require charging infrastructure. They work within the current fuel and servicing ecosystems. In Malaysia, where infrastructure is uneven and the grid is still greening – hybrids offer tangible carbon reductions today, not in some far-off future.

2. Hybrids accelerate readiness.

Electrification isn’t just about what’s under the bonnet – it’s about everything around it. After-sales support, technician training, roadside assistance, spare parts supply, and even insurance and resale values.

Hybrids help the broader ecosystem upskill and adapt. Every hybrid sold today builds the foundation for wider electrification tomorrow.

3. Hybrids build public trust.

They look and feel familiar. They require no new behaviours. In times of change, familiarity lowers the barrier to entry.

For many consumers, hybrids serve as a first step into electrification – without the fear of range anxiety or sticker shock.

This middle path also addresses a common misconception: that hybrids are a step backwards, or a distraction from full electrification. In reality, they are a necessary bridge & compliment to the journey of electrification.

They make low carbon mobility accessible to more people, more quickly.

Hybrids today aren’t the bolt-on tech of yesteryear. They are purpose-built, ground-up platforms with finely tuned synergy between electric motors and combustion engines.

These next-gen hybrids are lighter, smarter, and more efficient than ever before. They mark meaningful progress.

Of course, hybrids aren’t a silver bullet. They still burn fuel, yet hybrids can carry the bulk of the transition. They reduce emissions without overburdening infrastructure. They offer access without demanding sacrifice.

Globally, we’re seeing this shift play out. Countries are refining their approaches to a green future. Automakers are rebalancing investments.

Even in highly electrified markets, hybrids are regaining popularity. The world is learning that electrification isn’t a straight line – it’s a mosaic, shaped by context, cost, and consumer needs.

Malaysia’s path will be uniquely ours. But the goal is shared: a cleaner, more sustainable future.

By 2035, nearly 50% of vehicles worldwide could be electrified in some form, not all will be BEVs. And that’s okay. What matters is that we’re moving forward – and that we bring as many people along as possible.

A multi-pathway approach –hybrids, plug-ins, BEVs, and even fuel cell EVs – will deliver faster, fairer, and more scalable impact.

It ensures we’re not waiting for perfection before making progress. Because climate action delayed is climate action denied.

So while we plan for charging stations, incentives, and greener grids, hybrids give us a head start. They work now, with the systems we have.

They buy us time without burning through it. They get us moving – thoughtfully, accessibly, meaningful, and at scale.

The future isn’t just electric. It’s transitional. And that’s where hybrids shine.

(Bernama pic)

TAPAH : Ayer Kuning voters seem largely unconcerned by Perikatan Nasional’s “UmDAP” campaign to demonise the Umno-DAP relationship, and the outcry it raised over allegedly illegal pig farms.

More basic issues such as development of the constituency, better infrastructure and job opportunities are likely to determine how they cast their ballots today, according to voters who spoke to FMT.

Azhar Samsuri, 50, a resident of Kampung Simpang Tiga, said he felt largely unaffected by the pig farm issue as he was confident it could be resolved through modern farming systems.

What mattered most to folk like him was the need to bring in new industries into Ayer Kuning to provide job opportunities and uplift the local economy.

“When job opportunities increase, people here will have greater purchasing power, which then means traders get more customers and Ayer Kuning’s local economy will become more robust,” he said.

PAS vice-president Idris Ahmad had claimed that 30 farms were approved in the Batang Padang and Muallim districts, based on field observations.

This was denied by Perak executive councillor A Sivanesan, who said no new pig farms had been approved in Muslim-majority areas, while agriculture and food security minister Mohamad Sabu said the nine farms in Ayer Kuning were fully compliant with waste disposal regulations.

Azhar also expected the new assemblyman to think of ways to overcome flooding and traffic congestion in the area, as well as to help constituents struggling with the rising cost of living.

Job opportunities were also the top priority of another resident, who wanted to only be known as Poh Teik. He said having better jobs here will keep Ayer Kuning’s youths from moving to cities in search of employment.

“We need an assemblyman who can help develop this place. What’s important is providing jobs for locals.

“When you can do that, then our young don’t have to seek a livelihood away from home,” said Poh Teik, from Kampung Baru Coldstream.

M Ragu, 49, hoped that the next assemblyman would stay close to the ground and heed the grouses of constituents. The Kampung Simpang Tiga resident particularly hoped improvements could be made to the village’s surroundings so that it would look more organised.

“A comfortable home and environment can improve lives,” he said.

For Hisham Maarof, 24, he was unperturbed by PN playing up Umno and DAP’s alliance in hopes of getting Malay voters to shift their support away to the opposition coalition.

He believed other young voters like him were unbothered by such narratives and were more concerned about having decent job opportunities.

PN leaders have been using the “UmDAP” label to highlight Umno’s alliance with DAP under the unity government, which observers say remains a sensitive issue among Malay voters.

Perak DAP chief Nga Kor Ming had sought to normalise the label by pushing his own “UmDAP Mantap” brand, but think tank Ilham Centre said this had only yielded a more negative impact.

According to election data, Malay voters make up the majority of the electorate at 58%, followed by the Chinese (23%), Indians (14%) and others (5%).

State Agriculture, Agro-food Industry and Commodities Committee chairman Datuk Tuan Mohd Saripudin Tuan Ismail said the mill would produce five-kilogramme packets of rice under the Darul Naim brand, and is expected to create over 100 job opportunities for local residents.

He said the mill’s construction is a flagship project under his portfolio, in line with the state government’s goal to have its own paddy processing and rice production facilities through a state-owned agency.

“The initiative is being realised through a collaboration between Kumpulan Pertanian Kelantan Bhd and a private investor to build and operate the facility.

“The mill can process up to 600 metric tonnes of paddy per day, with a dry paddy storage capacity of over 40,000 metric tonnes,” he said during the State Legislative Assembly sitting at the Kota Darulnaim Complex here on Thursday.

He was responding to a question from Mohd Adanan Hassan (PAS-Kelaboran) on the state government’s efforts to ensure Kelantan is capable of producing its own rice.

On the value-added contribution by the investor, he said the collaboration also includes training in modern technology for farmers, especially the younger generation.

“The investor has outlined a strategic plan to train farmers with the latest technology, including organising several courses at a rice academy in Kedah.

“In addition, several high-tech solar pumps have been introduced in selected areas, to help offset agricultural production costs,” he said.

He added that the state government plans to establish a hybrid rice-seed production facility, under the same strategic collaboration, in line with Kelantan’s aspiration to become a rice bowl state.

To a supplementary question from Harun Ismail (PAS-Tawang) on the transparency of the mill’s operations, Tuan Mohd Saripudin gave his assurance that the rice produced would be 100% from locally sourced paddy, with no mixture of imported rice.",1.74559E+12,en,0.195163727,2025-04-24 09:15:16,"['per', 'following', 'agrofood', 'thursday', 'brand', 'bharu', 'pump', 'supplementary', 'resident', 'generation', 'assembly', 'including', 'darul', 'harvesting', 'build', 'addition', 'pasir', 'mixture', 'paskelaboran', 'season', 'completion', 'mohd', 'valueadded', 'producing', 'agriculture', 'train', 'expected', 'responding', 'collaboration', 'complex', 'tonne', 'plan', 'dry', 'hybrid', 'capable', 'mill', 'course', 'year', 'aspiration', 'hassan', 'riceseed', 'added', 'question', 'construction', 'committee', 'packet', 'kota', 'opportunity', 'pastawang', 'rice', 'introduced', 'paddy', 'also', 'realised', 'area', 'harun', 'become', 'stateowned', 'production', 'meranti', 'operate', 'especially', 'saripudin', 'state', 'latest', 'pertanian', 'datuk', 'hightech', 'set', 'produced', 'chairman', 'technology', 'legislative', 'investor', 'assurance', 'farmer', 'adanan', 'produce', 'fivekilogramme', 'kedah', 'august', 'private', 'metric', 'kelantan', 'agency', 'organising', 'transparency', 'commodity', 'tuan', 'effort', 'cost', 'anticipated', 'job', 'academy', 'bhd', 'first', 'create', 'introduce', 'ensure', 'sourced', 'kumpulan', 'capacity', 'modern', 'agricultural', 'darulnaim', 'ahead', 'kelantans', 'portfolio', 'naim', 'help', 'offset', 'would', 'imported', 'facility', 'outlined', 'government', 'gave', 'locally', 'flagship', 'day', 'operation', 'goal', 'bowl', 'strategic', 'processing', 'includes', 'local', 'initiative', 'younger', 'line', 'sitting', 'storage', 'april', 'industry', 'establish', 'several', 'said', 'training', 'project', 'contribution', 'selected', 'solar', 'process', 'ismail']",Neutral

Speaking at a dinner with Malaysians in the United Kingdom, Fadillah emphasised that these reservoirs would not only help manage floodwaters but also serve as crucial sources of water for various needs.

""The reservoirs will enable us to reserve water for use during droughts, ensuring a stable supply. The stored water can then be treated and distributed for various needs, whether for drinking, agriculture, industry, or other uses,"" he said.

Fadillah, who also serves as the Minister of Energy Transition and Water Transformation, noted that this initiative is part of broader efforts to address the challenges posed by climate change.

He highlighted the urgency of flood mitigation measures, citing the increasing frequency of extreme weather events in Malaysia.

""Our focus now is on mitigating floods due to climate change. Thunderstorms, strong winds, and other extreme weather events now result in a day’s rainfall equaling what used to fall in a month,"" he added.

""Places that have never experienced floods before are now inundated.""

Fadillah also pointed out the significant financial impact of flooding, stating that major flood events have led to losses amounting to RM3 billion, including recovery costs.

""We have to make sure we can reduce the impact of floods on the people, the financial impact not only on the people but also the country,"" he said.

In addition to flood management, Fadillah reaffirmed Malaysia's commitment to achieving 70% renewable energy by 2050, up from the current 28%.

This goal aligns with Malaysia's broader efforts to transition towards sustainable energy sources and reduce its carbon footprint.

During his visit to the UK, Fadillah led the Malaysian delegation at the Summit of the Future of Energy Security held at Lancaster House. The summit focused on global energy challenges and the importance of international collaboration in ensuring energy security.

Fadillah's statements underscore Malaysia's proactive approach to addressing environmental challenges through infrastructure development and international cooperation. - April 26, 2025",1.74569E+12,en,0.059477426,2025-04-26 02:32:00,"['rainfall', 'deputy', 'minister', 'flood', 'supply', 'mitigation', 'carbon', 'manage', 'mitigating', 'including', 'flooding', 'cooperation', 'pointed', 'addition', 'ensuring', 'crucial', 'yusof', 'seri', 'security', 'strong', 'inundated', 'agriculture', 'use', 'energy', 'collaboration', 'recovery', 'drinking', 'month', 'amounting', 'floodwaters', 'source', 'reservoir', 'underscore', 'change', 'infrastructure', 'transformation', 'stored', 'added', 'current', 'held', 'malaysian', 'construct', 'mitigate', 'weather', 'event', 'serve', 'international', 'aligns', 'also', 'transition', 'increasing', 'management', 'address', 'emphasised', 'posed', 'stable', 'used', 'highlighted', 'united', 'major', 'renewable', 'sure', 'fadillah', 'place', 'loss', 'commitment', 'wind', 'datuk', 'significant', 'set', 'impact', 'treated', 'focused', 'fall', 'make', 'kingdom', 'challenge', 'led', 'footprint', 'lancaster', 'never', 'addressing', 'distributed', 'visit', 'future', 'citing', 'statement', 'serf', 'financial', 'noted', 'water', 'development', 'effort', 'house', 'cost', 'environmental', 'stating', 'result', 'measure', 'global', 'equaling', 'need', 'country', 'drought', 'reaffirmed', 'dinner', 'enable', 'ensure', 'focus', 'people', 'climate', 'strategy', 'achieving', 'urgency', 'thunderstorm', 'approach', 'help', 'would', 'according', 'towards', 'proactive', 'speaking', 'summit', 'part', 'experienced', 'broader', 'reduce', 'day', 'fadillahs', 'goal', 'importance', 'initiative', 'whether', 'due', 'april', 'various', 'industry', 'multipurpose', 'malaysia', 'frequency', 'said', 'delegation', 'extreme', 'prime', 'billion', 'sustainable', 'reserve']",Neutral

On Thursday, April 24, Pattaya Mayor Poramet Ngampichet inspected and tested the newly completed Phase 1 of the Eastern Railway Parallel Road Drainage System, ensuring it’s ready for heavy rainfall.

The drainage project, part of a long-term strategy to tackle Pattaya’s chronic flooding issues, has been under construction for some time but faced delays due to complications with pillars for the high-speed railway. Despite these setbacks, the project has now moved forward, with a robust system in place to manage floodwaters. The infrastructure features 1.80-metre diameter pressure pipes extending 2,500 metres and 2-metre drainage pipes spanning 3,000 metres, covering a total of 5.5 kilometres.

The system is designed to store and pump floodwater from the Nong Prue Municipality, near Soi Khao Noi, and redirect it to Khlong Suea Phaew and Khlong Naklua, preventing overflow into Central Pattaya, including key areas like Sukhumvit Road, South Pattaya Intersection, and Soi Bongkot.

Mayor Poramet emphasised the importance of the project in alleviating the flooding that has often plagued the city, especially during the monsoon months. He noted that while Phase 1 is now operational, Phase 2 is expected to be completed by the end of 2026. Once both phases are finished, the city will assess the effectiveness of the system in managing floodwaters and protecting central Pattaya from future inundation, reported The Pattaya News.

This newly completed drainage system is a much-needed solution for a city that sees heavy rainfall throughout the year. The project promises to ease the strain on Pattaya’s infrastructure, ensuring that both residents and tourists alike can enjoy a smoother, safer experience during the wet season. As the city prepares for the rains, officials are hopeful that these improvements will provide long-term relief from the flooding that has long disrupted Pattaya’s streets.",1.74569E+12,en,0.45545736,2025-04-26 06:04:17,"['robust', 'rainfall', 'mayor', 'time', 'store', 'preventing', 'smoother', 'thursday', 'pump', 'manage', 'road', 'strain', 'resident', 'eastern', 'flooding', 'including', 'tourist', 'central', 'feature', 'overflow', 'ease', 'wet', 'sukhumvit', 'ensuring', 'protecting', 'newly', 'diameter', 'parallel', 'chronic', 'season', 'alleviating', 'finished', 'tackle', 'naklua', 'gearing', 'upgrade', 'expected', 'pressure', 'drainage', 'ready', 'floodwater', 'completed', 'rainy', 'month', 'floodwaters', 'promise', 'throughout', 'year', 'infrastructure', 'often', 'effectiveness', 'metre', 'redirect', 'pattaya', 'nong', 'noi', 'construction', 'extending', 'prepares', 'street', 'improvement', 'area', 'official', 'highspeed', 'bongkot', 'key', 'suea', 'emphasised', 'especially', 'safer', 'experience', 'end', 'pillar', 'covering', 'prue', 'major', 'long', 'place', 'faced', 'near', 'issue', 'managing', 'railway', 'plagued', 'provide', 'complication', 'news', 'see', 'future', 'pattayas', 'city', 'intersection', 'noted', 'alike', 'poramet', 'soi', 'hopeful', 'kilometre', 'operational', 'heavy', 'south', 'despite', 'reported', 'phase', 'strategy', 'setback', 'longterm', 'rain', 'total', 'solution', 'inspected', 'system', 'part', 'muchneeded', 'phaew', 'moved', 'inundation', 'importance', 'delay', 'khao', 'forward', 'enjoy', 'monsoon', 'municipality', 'assess', 'disrupted', 'due', 'april', 'relief', 'spanning', 'pipe', 'project', 'designed', 'khlong', 'tested', 'new', 'ngampichet', 'combat', 'like']",Neutral

State Infrastructure and Agriculture Committee chairman Datuk Ir Izham Hashim said the decision was reached at a special coordination meeting held yesterday between state executive councillors, several assemblymen, related local authorities as well as government agencies such as the Selangor Public Works Department and the Department of Irrigation and Drainage (DID).

The DID presented long term and middle term plans along with immediate measures to tackle floods in the three areas during the meeting, he added.

“For Meru, unowned drains will be maintained and flag gates will be installed at Sungai Binjai as part of the Sungai Kapar Kecil and Sungai Kapar Besar flood mitigation plans. Booster pumps at Sungai Binjai will be activated as well,” he said in a statement here today.

For Taman Seri Muda, immediate measures taken include upgrading the aging drainage system to a higher level of protection, at least 20 average recurrence intervals for the entire area, he said.

“The damaged flap gate to Sungai Klang will also be replaced, and the Taman Sri Muda retention pond will be enlarged, with strengthening and upgrading of soil bunds at the banks of Sungai Klang and its construction along the banks of Sungai Rasau.

“Other measures include enforcement on trespassing on river land reserves and the shifting of utility cables and pipes that obstruct drains and the upgrade of the No 3 water control gate automated system,” Izham said, adding that the Selangor DID had also presented progress reports on the repair work done for the flood retention pond in Hillpark, Puncak Alam that broke for the second time, flooding Taman Seri Alam early yesterday morning.

He said Hillpark Resources had suggested several immediate measures to tackle the problem that will be implemented this week during discussions with the DID and residents’ association, adding that he would visit the area to chart the progress as well as the immediate and long-term measures agreed upon in the area.",1.74561E+12,en,-0.065647557,2025-04-24 13:31:00,"['time', 'flood', 'meeting', 'pond', 'recurrence', 'average', 'mitigation', 'activated', 'early', 'pump', 'work', 'broke', 'resident', 'flooding', 'bank', 'kecil', 'hashim', 'seri', 'include', 'tackle', 'booster', 'kapar', 'agriculture', 'decision', 'upgrade', 'drainage', 'besar', 'plan', 'bunds', 'sungai', 'taken', 'infrastructure', 'suggested', 'irrigation', 'term', 'upon', 'utility', 'added', 'held', 'strengthening', 'construction', 'three', 'river', 'committee', 'replaced', 'progress', 'middle', 'also', 'area', 'meru', 'immediate', 'floodprone', 'automated', 'shifting', 'special', 'protection', 'klang', 'flag', 'upgrading', 'today', 'reached', 'state', 'association', 'long', 'interval', 'related', 'enforcement', 'control', 'datuk', 'enlarged', 'chairman', 'selangor', 'discussion', 'well', 'flap', 'hillpark', 'muda', 'drain', 'least', 'entire', 'visit', 'agreed', 'damaged', 'statement', 'morning', 'agency', 'maintained', 'water', 'aging', 'binjai', 'unowned', 'presented', 'authority', 'measure', 'taman', 'adding', 'higher', 'done', 'gate', 'rasau', 'trespassing', 'installed', 'alam', 'implemented', 'executive', 'week', 'report', 'retention', 'longterm', 'would', 'soil', 'public', 'system', 'second', 'part', 'repair', 'government', 'shah', 'yesterday', 'chart', 'obstruct', 'puncak', 'local', 'problem', 'sri', 'several', 'department', 'land', 'said', 'pipe', 'level', 'cable', 'councillor', 'along', 'assemblyman', 'reserve', 'resource', 'implement', 'coordination', 'izham']",Neutral

This corporate social responsibility initiative, organised by CIDB in collaboration with six construction companies, focused on repairing the hall, which serves as a vital hub for local community activities.

The participating companies were Hyup Soon Industries Sdn Bhd, Paling Construction Sdn Bhd, China Communications Construction Company (M) Sdn Bhd, Score EPCC Sdn Bhd, and Hing Teck Glass & Aluminium Sdn Bhd.

CIDB Malaysia Chairman, Yusuf Abdul Wahab, said the programme demonstrates the construction industry’s ability not only to build infrastructure but also to restore hope for affected communities.

He noted that this initiative stemmed from strategic collaboration between CIDB, leading contractors, and local agencies such as the Bintulu Resident’s Office and the Bintulu District Office.

“This programme proves that the construction industry plays a vital role in community support – not just by building structures, but by rebuilding lives.

“This hall is more than just a building; it’s the heart of the community, hosting weddings, children’s tuition classes, residents’ meetings, and more.

“Restoring it was essential and a shared responsibility,” he said.

Yusuf made the remarks during the official handover of the Build Brigade CSR Programme, officiated by Jepak assemblyman Iskandar Turkee at the Kampung Kemunting community hall on Wednesday.

The repairs included fencing, doors, industrial fans, roller shutter systems, electrical equipment, and a full repainting of the hall.

MOSCOW : Iranian oil minister Mohsen Paknejad said during a visit to Moscow today that Iran would boost cooperation with Russia in agriculture and banking and remove barriers in all spheres of cooperation between the two countries.

Russia has deepened ties with Iran since the start of the military conflict in Ukraine and signed a strategic partnership treaty with Tehran in January.

Both countries are under Western sanctions.

Speaking on state TV earlier today, Paknejad said Iran will sign a US$4 billion agreement with Russian companies to develop seven Iranian oilfields.

Russia has a long history of cooperation with Iran and helped build a nuclear reactor at Bushehr in the south of the country, Iran’s first.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, at a meeting with his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian in January in the Kremlin, said Russia may eventually supply up to 55 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas per year to Iran, though starting from lower volumes of up to 2bcm.

A figure of 55 bcm would be similar to the throughput of the Nord Stream 1 undersea pipelines to Europe that were damaged by blasts in 2022 and have not delivered any gas since then.

Russian gas giant Gazprom signed a memorandum last June with the National Iranian Gas Company to supply Russian pipeline gas to Iran.

Possible routes for the pipeline have not been disclosed.

Paknejad, speaking at a Russia-Iran intergovernmental commission in Moscow, said Iran would implement the agreements with Gazprom, including on a regional hub for distribution of gas.

The two countries have long discussed setting up such a hub in Iran, with the possible participation of Qatar and Turkmenistan.

Opec+

Yesterday Paknejad met Russian deputy prime minister Alexander Novak, Putin’s point man on relations with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec).

The meeting took place as several members of Opec+, the group comprising Opec and its allies led by Russia, suggested the group accelerates oil output hikes in June for a second consecutive month, three sources familiar with Opec+ talks told Reuters.

The proposed hikes underscore a worsening dispute between members over compliance with production quotas.

They come after calls from US President Donald Trump for Opec to lower oil prices and his return to a policy of “maximum pressure” on Iran, whose oil exports Washington wants to reduce to zero.",1.74567E+12,en,-0.100187883,2025-04-25 09:13:06,"['per', 'russiairan', 'minister', 'deputy', 'reuters', 'washington', 'meeting', 'intergovernmental', 'counterpart', 'mohsen', 'donald', 'supply', 'alexander', 'including', 'policy', 'deepened', 'military', 'cooperation', 'quota', 'build', 'man', 'export', 'conflict', 'ukraine', 'treaty', 'return', 'gas', 'develop', 'agriculture', 'start', 'pressure', 'sphere', 'bushehr', 'pipeline', 'nord', 'distribution', 'june', 'month', 'last', 'proposed', 'source', 'january', 'year', 'hike', 'oil', 'boost', 'suggested', 'underscore', 'sanction', 'metre', 'may', 'member', 'three', 'gazprom', 'come', 'participation', 'trump', 'though', 'cubic', 'organization', 'since', 'reactor', 'banking', 'europe', 'stream', 'opec', 'regional', 'production', 'call', 'barrier', 'starting', 'throughput', 'similar', 'setting', 'group', 'today', 'bcm', 'state', 'earlier', 'long', 'place', 'comprising', 'talk', 'possible', 'output', 'giant', 'vladimir', 'met', 'accelerates', 'two', 'led', 'partnership', 'oilfield', 'volume', 'hub', 'memorandum', 'commission', 'masoud', 'tie', 'helped', 'pezeshkian', 'lower', 'agreement', 'visit', 'moscow', 'eventually', 'damaged', 'point', 'sign', 'worsening', 'figure', 'undersea', 'dispute', 'disclosed', 'first', 'tehran', 'price', 'country', 'pic', 'route', 'ally', 'maximum', 'iran', 'petroleum', 'south', 'remove', 'paknejad', 'russian', 'national', 'company', 'novak', 'exporting', 'qatar', 'would', 'nuclear', 'delivered', 'discussed', 'speaking', 'second', 'zero', 'iranian', 'turkmenistan', 'want', 'yesterday', 'compliance', 'relation', 'familiar', 'reduce', 'took', 'putin', 'strategic', 'whose', 'kremlin', 'seven', 'history', 'several', 'western', 'said', 'president', 'blast', 'prime', 'billion', 'signed', 'consecutive', 'told', 'implement', 'russia']",Neutral
agriculture,Uganda’s Growth Story Unfolds as Diplomacy Delivers Economic Gains,1.74551E+12,SoftPower News,softpower.ug,https://news.google.com/read/CBMikAFBVV95cUxOS3FyY25ucmFuNlVKelRlNWx4VEgyU051OC1XYXVJSkd4dUNubTJKMmloenNUS05MQ0JhV2RKSnhENkJVNFlBSTRuc1ZndXdoeHlKYTV6MU5oSFpKdlcyV3FXOXAxQU1MUlZnamR1TW40aE1IOEJxLUdOTW8yZTdmc29KbWFRZ2c3eEhNRlc5dEw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://softpower.ug/ugandas-growth-story-unfolds-as-diplomacy-delivers-economic-gains/,"Uganda has launched a bold economic agenda aimed at expanding the size of its economy from USD 50 billion in FY 2022/23 to USD 500 billion by 2040. Central to this ambition is a robust investment strategy that positions Uganda as a premier destination for global capital.

Speaking at the Pearl of Africa Trade Expo in Malaysia, Uganda’s Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, Hon. Matia Kasaija, highlighted the country’s stable macroeconomic environment, fully liberalised economy, and resilient currency as key drivers of investor confidence. He noted that the private sector—accounting for nearly 80% of GDP—is fueling growing demand for intermediate goods and services, especially within the manufacturing sector.

“We offer affordable power tariffs for large industries, a secure and peaceful environment, and a strong policy framework that enhances export competitiveness,” said Minister Kasaija. “Foreign Direct Investment flows have risen steadily—from USD 1.2 billion in 2020 to USD 3.0 billion in 2023.”

The Uganda High Commission in Malaysia organised the Trade Expo to unlock trade and investment opportunities within the ASEAN bloc, comprising Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. The Expo, now recognised as the first East African Community (EAC) Expo in ASEAN, reflects Uganda’s renewed focus on economic and commercial diplomacy.

“Malaysia is well placed to support Uganda’s transition from low-value to high-value exports,” Kasaija remarked, encouraging investment in key sectors such as Agro-industrialisation, Tourism Development, Mineral-Based Industries, including Oil & Gas, and Science, Technology, and Innovation, including ICT and the Creative Economy.

According to the IMF, Uganda’s economy is among the fastest-growing globally, with real GDP growth projected at 7.5% in 2025. The Government’s overarching goal is to fully monetise the economy, enhance self-sufficiency, and drive structural transformation.

As a member of the East African Community (EAC), Common Market for East and Southern Africa (COMESA), and the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), Uganda benefits from preferential access to a combined market of over 1.5 billion people and a GDP exceeding USD 3 trillion.

Kasaija also pointed to increasing returns on investment in Uganda, which surpassed 14% in 2022, and noted the diversification of Uganda’s export basket over the past 15 years, with 31 new products—many of them manufactured goods—added. These include concentrated milk, hair products, butter, casein, and paper labels.

Addressing the same forum, Hon. Ruth Nankabirwa, Minister of Energy and Mineral Development, emphasised the untapped potential in Uganda’s petroleum and energy sectors.

“Only 40% of Uganda’s petroleum resources have been explored,” she said. “There are significant opportunities in electricity generation, transmission, and distribution to meet regional demand.”

She highlighted ongoing geological and airborne geophysical surveys across the country, which are generating critical data to support mineral and energy development.

“We are ready to support investment in mineral exploration, mining, processing, and value addition—with a full package of investor incentives and infrastructure support,” Nankabirwa added.

On the sidelines of the Expo, Uganda’s delegation held high-level discussions with Malaysian government officials, including Hon. YB Liew Chin Tong, Malaysia’s Deputy Minister of Investment, Trade, and Industry. Malaysia expressed strong interest in bilateral partnerships, particularly in the agriculture sector.

Hon. Bright Rwamirama, Uganda’s State Minister for Agriculture, presented the country’s agricultural strengths—including 16.5 million cattle, 18.5 million goats and sheep, and 8 million pigs—alongside numerous investment-ready opportunities.

The Expo drew participation from key stakeholders across the ASEAN region, including Hon. Yang Berhormat Datuk Seri Haji Mohamad Bin Sabu, Malaysia’s Minister of Agriculture and Food Security, reflecting growing international confidence in Uganda’s investment potential.",1.74559E+12,en,0.673926771,2025-04-24 14:51:59,"['uganda', 'robust', 'full', 'minister', 'deputy', 'cattle', 'butter', 'fueling', 'nearly', 'direct', 'asean', 'philippine', 'tong', 'goat', 'sector', 'goodsadded', 'across', 'investmentready', 'critical', 'usd', 'high', 'flow', 'policy', 'including', 'monetise', 'hair', 'bold', 'generation', 'particularly', 'chin', 'central', 'pointed', 'liberalised', 'matia', 'real', 'export', 'preferential', 'drew', 'steadilyfrom', 'additionwith', 'return', 'imf', 'ict', 'trade', 'gas', 'market', 'paper', 'include', 'intermediate', 'seri', 'security', 'strong', 'untapped', 'common', 'agriculture', 'past', 'brunei', 'driver', 'globally', 'energy', 'enhance', 'distribution', 'ready', 'mohamad', 'offer', 'investment', 'renewed', 'africa', 'food', 'sideline', 'fully', 'african', 'surpassed', 'year', 'aimed', 'oil', 'within', 'selfsufficiency', 'continental', 'infrastructure', 'sabu', 'transformation', 'myanmar', 'geophysical', 'value', 'lowvalue', 'added', 'member', 'placed', 'held', 'trillion', 'package', 'malaysian', 'pearl', 'participation', 'milk', 'international', 'kasaija', 'power', 'opportunity', 'thailand', 'projected', 'economic', 'also', 'forum', 'transition', 'bright', 'increasing', 'area', 'good', 'official', 'key', 'highlevel', 'manufactured', 'emphasised', 'productsmany', 'regional', 'science', 'agenda', 'stable', 'creative', 'especially', 'encouraging', 'stakeholder', 'highlighted', 'drive', 'structural', 'launched', 'ruth', 'potential', 'haji', 'benefit', 'state', 'comprising', 'diplomacy', 'mineral', 'combined', 'significant', 'datuk', 'remarked', 'mining', 'expanding', 'diversification', 'free', 'exploration', 'framework', 'technology', 'risen', 'discussion', 'well', 'investor', 'incentive', 'position', 'partnership', 'sheep', 'secure', 'commission', 'basket', 'peaceful', 'numerous', 'transmission', 'addressing', 'hon', 'private', 'mineralbased', 'organised', 'product', 'among', 'resilient', 'tariff', 'confidence', 'gdpis', 'gdp', 'support', 'noted', 'development', 'comesa', 'ambition', 'region', 'planning', 'demand', 'survey', 'million', 'airborne', 'presented', 'capital', 'premier', 'global', 'service', 'manufacturing', 'unlock', 'first', 'country', 'recognised', 'commercial', 'access', 'rwamirama', 'explored', 'highvalue', 'sectoraccounting', 'focus', 'innovation', 'people', 'petroleum', 'agricultural', 'label', 'tourism', 'vietnam', 'expo', 'concentrated', 'strategy', 'electricity', 'geological', 'large', 'growth', 'size', 'interest', 'community', 'macroeconomic', 'affordable', 'meet', 'pigsalongside', 'finance', 'according', 'berhormat', 'east', 'nankabirwa', 'speaking', 'competitiveness', 'government', 'economy', 'agroindustrialisation', 'growing', 'bloc', 'ongoing', 'foreign', 'singapore', 'environment', 'fastestgrowing', 'goal', 'generating', 'processing', 'overarching', 'lao', 'currency', 'yang', 'casein', 'data', 'indonesia', 'reflects', 'industry', 'eac', 'cambodia', 'malaysia', 'delegation', 'said', 'afcfta', 'bilateral', 'strengthsincluding', 'exceeding', 'expressed', 'bin', 'billion', 'southern', 'new', 'destination', 'enhances', 'resource', 'reflecting', 'liew']",Positive

According to a TVS news report, Uganda’s High Commissioner to Malaysia, Dr Betty Oyella Bigombe, expressed her country’s interest in tapping into Sarawak’s expertise, especially in gas separation and oil refinery development – areas where Uganda is still in its early stages.

She noted that oil and gas are key focus sectors for Uganda, with refinery construction just beginning, and highlighted Sarawak’s valuable experience in the field.

“In terms of agriculture, there are many things we can share with Sarawak. We are involved in coffee cultivation, dairy production, as well as oil palm.

“We are also learning from Sarawak and hope that this cooperation will continue,” she said.

She said this when met by the media after paying a courtesy call on the Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg at Wisma Bapa Malaysia on Thursday.

According to her, the tourism sector was also discussed during the one-on-one meeting, which she sees as having great potential to be explored, given that both Sarawak and Uganda have their own respective strengths.

Her side is also open to establishing cooperation in other critical sectors such as trade, which could open up new markets between the two countries.

Meanwhile, Energy and Environmental Sustainability Deputy Minister, Datuk Dr Hazland Abang Hipni, when met by the media, said Uganda’s energy landscape, dominated by 86 per cent hydroelectricity, resembles Sarawak’s energy structure, making it an ideal platform for collaboration.

“Uganda is exploring the oil and gas sector. This opens up major opportunities for state-related companies, such as PETROS, to get involved.

“This strategic potential should be tapped into,” he said.

To further strengthen bilateral relations, Bigombe extended an official invitation to Abang Johari and Dr Hazland for a working visit to Uganda.",1.74567E+12,en,0.714339793,2025-04-25 10:44:26,"['uganda', 'stage', 'per', 'deputy', 'minister', 'meeting', 'thursday', 'openg', 'sector', 'early', 'critical', 'side', 'sustainability', 'high', 'involved', 'mutually', 'tapped', 'cooperation', 'build', 'cultivation', 'commissioner', 'bigombe', 'continue', 'patinggi', 'extended', 'market', 'gas', 'trade', 'cent', 'explore', 'agriculture', 'energy', 'collaboration', 'courtesy', 'tapping', 'resembles', 'dairy', 'expertise', 'oil', 'establishing', 'term', 'oyella', 'hope', 'tan', 'construction', 'could', 'respective', 'hazland', 'opportunity', 'beneficial', 'learning', 'also', 'area', 'official', 'key', 'production', 'call', 'abang', 'especially', 'experience', 'hipni', 'working', 'separation', 'highlighted', 'refinery', 'potential', 'major', 'oneonone', 'medium', 'datuk', 'sarawak', 'bapa', 'meanwhile', 'strength', 'met', 'two', 'open', 'partnership', 'well', 'platform', 'tie', 'news', 'see', 'kuching', 'visit', 'landscape', 'get', 'ideal', 'noted', 'development', 'coffee', 'environmental', 'premier', 'exploring', 'country', 'strengthen', 'valuable', 'staterelated', 'explored', 'given', 'focus', 'johari', 'invitation', 'thing', 'hydroelectricity', 'tourism', 'dominated', 'report', 'field', 'company', 'longterm', 'interest', 'according', 'share', 'discussed', 'betty', 'great', 'tun', 'relation', 'wisma', 'strategic', 'sri', 'still', 'palm', 'malaysia', 'structure', 'said', 'many', 'bilateral', 'beginning', 'expressed', 'making', 'paying', 'new', 'petros', 'keen']",Positive

(EPA Images pic)

GENEVA : The World Food Programme warned on Friday it is facing a funding shortfall that could affect its ability to support people facing acute food shortages in Sudan within weeks as donor states reduce humanitarian funding.

The UN agency said it has a shortfall in funding of US$698 million out of the nearly US$800 million it had asked for from donors to help seven million people from May through to September.

There will be shortages of items, such as cereals, pulses and ready-to-use food from May as it is confronted with a broader trend of global donor states reducing humanitarian funding, the organisation warned.

Rations in areas at risk of famine have been reduced to 70% of a standard WFP ration (equal to 2100 kcal per day), the organisation said.

“We are stressing the need to ensure funding flows at a very critical time where we are entering the rainy season and also the hunger season in Sudan, and at a time when conflict is escalating and displacements are increasing,” Samantha Chattaraj, the WFP’s Sudan country office emergency coordinator told reporters in Geneva via video link from Port Sudan.

The war in Sudan erupted in April 2023, sparked by a power struggle between the army and the rival Rapid Support Forces. The conflict has since displaced millions.

The WFP said it is mobilising support across the country, including to some of the 450,000 people displaced from Sudan’s Zamzam camp in North Darfur after it was taken over by the RSF earlier this month.

The organisation said it had assisted 4 million people across Sudan in March – the highest monthly figure since conflict began – and is now able to reach more areas, after overcoming bureaucratic challenges and insecurity.

Malaysian airline AirAsia X is set to launch regular flights to Uzbekistan in the fall of this year, according to the State Committee for Tourism.

On April 24, the airline’s Chairman Kamarudin Meranun and CEO Benyamin Ismail held talks with representatives of the committee and local tour operators. The discussions focused on expanding air connectivity and enhancing the bilateral tourism potential between Malaysia and Uzbekistan.

Starting from October, the airline plans to operate three weekly flights on the Kuala Lumpur – Tashkent – Kuala Lumpur route. The two sides also explored the possibility of establishing connecting flights to third countries via this route.

Another key topic of the meeting was the development of pilgrimage tourism in Uzbekistan under the “Umrah Plus” program. The Malaysian delegation highlighted the growing interest among Malaysian travelers in Uzbekistan’s Islamic heritage and religious traditions, noting the country’s significance as part of regional pilgrimage routes.

AirAsia X received official permission from Uzbekistan’s Civil Aviation Authority to operate regular flights to the country in early February. Around the same time, South Korea’s T’way Air was also granted approval to launch flights between Tashkent and Seoul.

Also, in February, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev instructed relevant authorities to introduce a special “Umrah Plus” tourism package for Malaysian and Indonesian pilgrims.

(Facebook pic)

PETALING JAYA : Narrow-minded ideologies that judge people based on skin colour or religion should not be allowed to spread in schools, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said today.

He said such views, which he described as foolish, would divide the people and damage the country, Bernama reported.

“I don’t care if it is a Malay school, a religious school, a Tamil school or a Chinese school – this kind of thinking must not exist because it will divide and destroy our country,” he said in Ipoh at a gathering with schoolchildren in his Tambun parliamentary constituency.

Anwar also called for quick action by schools to help schoolchildren to master digital technology and artificial intelligence.

He said the country is advancing and attracting significant investments, particularly in semiconductors, data centres and AI, therefore, students who wish to succeed must master new knowledge.

“We must master digital technology and AI. These are the technologies of the future. To succeed, you must master them. That is why our universities now have AI faculties, every university has an AI unit and department, and it cuts across all disciplines.

“I also hope schools move quickly. We cannot plan for five years before starting. It must begin that same year. If we cannot start with 100 schools, start with 50. We must have the courage to bring change,” he said.

He also gave a reminder that English proficiency is important from a trade perspective, and Mandarin is increasingly seen as essential, given China’s growing economic influence.

He said Malaysia still faces workforce challenges, especially a shortage of engineers to meet demand from the various companies investing in the country.

“We now have prominent AI, digital and semiconductor companies, but if we continue with the current projections, we will be short of 30,000 engineers,” he said.",1.74569E+12,en,-0.323116362,2025-04-25 12:30:42,"['constituency', 'minister', 'meeting', 'knowledge', 'cut', 'across', 'china', 'ibrahim', 'particularly', 'quickly', 'judge', 'perspective', 'mandarin', 'continue', 'parliamentary', 'trade', 'move', 'dont', 'projection', 'narrowminded', 'start', 'damage', 'face', 'care', 'plan', 'proficiency', 'investment', 'kind', 'advancing', 'religion', 'spread', 'bring', 'year', 'change', 'discipline', 'allowed', 'must', 'essential', 'hope', 'investing', 'current', 'university', 'economic', 'quick', 'also', 'based', 'faculty', 'reminder', 'workforce', 'facebook', 'student', 'starting', 'especially', 'attracting', 'ipoh', 'today', 'chinese', 'english', 'destroy', 'ideology', 'colour', 'petaling', 'significant', 'courage', 'called', 'view', 'skin', 'important', 'technology', 'challenge', 'master', 'centre', 'described', 'malay', 'future', 'unit', 'religious', 'begin', 'schoolchildren', 'jaya', 'foolish', 'demand', 'tambun', 'bernama', 'country', 'semiconductor', 'action', 'short', 'divide', 'pic', 'given', 'wish', 'every', 'people', 'digital', 'influence', 'reported', 'gathering', 'company', 'help', 'five', 'succeed', 'intelligence', 'would', 'meet', 'exist', 'gave', 'shortage', 'growing', 'anwar', 'artificial', 'school', 'prominent', 'thinking', 'data', 'still', 'therefore', 'various', 'department', 'malaysia', 'said', 'engineer', 'increasingly', 'prime', 'seen', 'new', 'tamil']",Neutral

The embassy of Malaysia, Yangon, Myanmar, stated on its Facebook page that the services include obstetrics and gynaecology, medical, surgery, orthopaedics, paediatrics, dentistry, ear, nose and throat (ENT), and ophthalmology.

“The public can seek free medical treatment from 8am to 5pm daily [except Fridays],” said the posting.

On Thursday, Bernama reported that more than 500 outpatients have received treatment at the Malaysian Field Hospital (HMM), operated by the Malaysian Armed Forces (ATM) in Myanmar’s Sagaing district since April 21.

Chief of Defence Force, General Datuk Mohd Nizam Jaffar, said the hospital is expected to operate for one month, though the period may be extended if necessary.

On April 18, Malaysia dispatched an ATM medical team to Myanmar to carry out Operation Starlight III, a post-disaster humanitarian aid initiative.

According to the Information Team of Myanmar’s State Administration Council, the 7.9-magnitude earthquake that struck Myanmar on March 28 claimed 3,726 lives, injured 5,105 people, and left 129 still unaccounted for as of April 18.

Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines are the four main durian suppliers to China, with Vietnam and Thailand dominating.

However, Vietnam’s durian market share in China dropped sharply to 37 percent in the first two months of 2025, from 61.7 percent the previous year, when Vietnam became the top supplier.

By contrast, Thailand’s share surged from 36.9 percent to 62.3 percent, overtaking Vietnam to reclaim the lead.

The sharp decline in durian exports from both Thailand and Vietnam to China stems from China’s stricter quality checks, particularly for heavy metals and Auramine O.

Vietnam’s durian exports have faced warnings from Chinese customs about fraudulent growing area codes, non-compliance with plant quarantine, and food safety regulations.

As a result, many domestic businesses have had to halt exports to complete documentation, as China now inspects 100 percent of import shipments related to Auramine O.

Consequently, domestic durian prices have plummeted. Ri6 and Monthong durian is sold at VND35,000-120,000 per kg at gardens. During the off-season last year, the prices hit a record high of nearly VND200,000 per kg.

By 2025, Vietnam’s durian cultivation area had grown to about 169,000 hectares, with an expected output of 1.55 million tons. Besides domestic consumption, China remains the primary export market, which consumes over 90 percent of Vietnam’s durian export value.

Malaysia is ambitiously eyeing China’s market, offering incentives for durian cultivation. Local newspapers quoted Malaysia’s Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Food Security, Datuk Arthur Joseph Kurup, as reporting that 413.61 tons of fresh durian, valued at RM24.84 million ($5.29 million), were exported to China from August to December last year.

Malaysian durian are now available in 16 Chinese regions, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Tianjin, and Chengdu.

Notably, China’s durian market is growing steadily and is forecast to reach $10 billion in value soon. The country consumes about 91 percent of global durian, with supplies mainly from Thailand and Vietnam. However, China is actively seeking new suppliers to diversify its import market.

Laos’ strong rise

In this context, Laos is emerging as a potential competitor. Recently, Attapeu province authorities granted investment rights to three domestic firms to grow durian commercially on an area of over 273 hectares.

Laos aims to become a durian supplier to China, where demand continues to soar. Last October, Chinese companies met with Laos’ National Chamber of Commerce and Industry to discuss forming a Lao Durian Business Association and a durian research center.

These initiatives aim to build a systematic management system for variety selection, cultivation techniques, quality control and logistics, aiming at sustainable exports to the Chinese market.

The Lao government has allocated 12,000 hectares of agricultural land to Chinese firms to develop specialized durian export zones.

Beyond expanding durian cultivation in Laos, China’s General Administration of Customs completed inspections of durian plantations and packing facilities in Indonesia in March 2025 to assess export potential.

With an annual output of 1.83 million tons, Indonesia is among the world’s largest durian producers. Its durian industry is tackling logistics and quarantine issues to enter the Chinese market.

In Sulawesi province, the total registered durian cultivation area has reached 3,056 hectares in five localities, with Parigi Moutong, Poso, and Sigi deemed ready for export.

This means that besides traditional rivals (Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines), Vietnam’s durian will have to compete fiercely with Indonesia and Laos in China.

Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Environment Phung Duc Tien, said durian is a key crop with many advantages for Vietnam, bringing significant export value. Recently, Vietnam’s frozen durian was approved for export to China.

“We need to work seriously and systematically to sustain this vital industry’s growth,” he said. He stressed that non-compliant businesses must urgently rectify their operation to maintain market share in China.

Farmers, cooperatives, and exporters have been warned of the risk of losing the Chinese market if they do not strictly control durian quality, traceability and growing area codes.

The forum, which runs for two days, aims to unlock an estimated USD 5 billion in trade and investment opportunities over the next five years, targeting Malaysian and broader Asian investors.

Held under the theme “Unlocking Uganda’s Business Potential,” the Expo is drawing attention to Uganda’s growing portfolio of opportunities across five key sectors: agro-industrialisation, tourism, oil and gas, science and technology, and mineral development.

A High-Level Ugandan Delegation Champions the Investment Drive

Leading Uganda’s investment delegation is Finance Minister Hon. Matia Kasaija, who emphasized Uganda’s commitment to creating a friendly investment climate, noting that the country has established a supportive legal and policy framework that safeguards investor interests. The delegation also includes:

Hon. Ruth Nankabirwa , Minister of Energy and Mineral Development

Hon. Bright Rwamirama , Minister of State for Animal Industry

Amb. Betty O. Bigombe , Uganda’s High Commissioner to Malaysia

Ms. Olive Kigongo , President of the Uganda National Chamber of Commerce

Mrs. Susan Muhwezi , Senior Presidential Adviser on Exports

Amb. Charles Ssentongo, Chief of Protocol

The opening ceremony was graced by Hon. Yang Bhg Muhtar Hashim, Executive Director of the Chemical Industries Council of Malaysia, who welcomed Ugandan delegates and confirmed Malaysia’s interest in deepening bilateral trade cooperation.

Key Investment Sectors Unveiled

1. Oil and Gas

Energy Minister Ruth Nankabirwa highlighted Uganda’s strategy to ban the export of raw materials to encourage in-country processing and value addition. “Our iron ore is the best in the world. We have copper, oil, gold, and other critical minerals,” she said, inviting investors to tap into refining, smelting, and logistics.

Nankabirwa also spotlighted flagship projects including:

The East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP)

The Hoima Oil Refinery

Creation of logistics hubs to serve the petroleum supply chain

2. Mineral Development

Uganda boasts a range of untapped mineral wealth — from gold and copper to rare earth elements and cobalt. The government is offering favorable terms for sustainable exploitation, including incentives for companies that invest in mineral beneficiation and green extraction technologies.

3. Agro-Industrialisation

With vast stretches of fertile land and year-round favorable weather, Uganda is positioning itself as an agro-processing powerhouse. Opportunities exist in value addition, agricultural mechanization, post-harvest storage, and export-driven agribusiness.

4. Tourism Development

Uganda’s rich natural heritage is also a cornerstone of its investment strategy. Ambassador Bigombe encouraged development in:

Eco-lodges and resort infrastructure

Adventure and wildlife tourism

National parks such as Kidepo Valley, Queen Elizabeth, and Murchison Falls

Rwenzori Mountains, ideal for alpine tourism and trekking

5. Science, Technology, and Innovation

Uganda is rapidly digitizing, with investments in ICT parks, youth innovation hubs, and local assembly of tech devices. Government support includes infrastructure, training programs, and partnerships with global tech players.

Uganda Offers Competitive Incentives to Global Investors

Uganda’s investment framework is among the most liberal in Africa. According to Ambassador Bigombe, the country permits 100% foreign ownership in most sectors, ensures unrestricted repatriation of profits, and offers:

Tax holidays

Customs duty exemptions

Infrastructure support

Access to a one-stop investment facilitation center operated by the Uganda Investment Authority (UIA)

The UIA has profiled over 120 bankable projects in various fields including road infrastructure, agribusiness parks, tourism sites, and industrial development zones, many of which are now open for Malaysian and other international investors.

Strategic Regional Access: EAC and COMESA

Ambassador Bigombe emphasized Uganda’s strategic position as a gateway to the East African Community (EAC) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA). “Investors who choose Uganda don’t just tap into a single market — they gain access to over 300 million consumers across the region,” she noted.

She described the Forum as a bridge between vision and opportunity, asserting that partnerships formed here will not only benefit Uganda and Malaysia but also bolster regional economic growth and integration.

Strong Interest from Private Sector Players

The Expo has attracted notable private investors, trade delegations, and business associations from both Uganda and Malaysia. Attendees have expressed optimism about forming joint ventures, establishing supply chains, and exploring public-private partnerships in high-impact areas.

As the two-day Forum progresses, follow-up meetings and bilateral discussions are expected to shape long-term cooperation frameworks, particularly in infrastructure, energy, and technology.",1.74569E+12,en,0.569842517,2025-04-25 14:14:51,"['resort', 'minister', 'formed', 'sector', 'attendee', 'road', 'policy', 'uia', 'cooperation', 'champion', 'operated', 'adviser', 'market', 'center', 'exploitation', 'holiday', 'lumpur', 'investment', 'logistics', 'material', 'run', 'world', 'oil', 'charles', 'vision', 'term', 'value', 'protocol', 'council', 'held', 'element', 'malaysian', 'weather', 'vast', 'murchison', 'incountry', 'yearround', 'unrestricted', 'amb', 'wealth', 'rwenzori', 'spotlighted', 'ruth', 'exportdriven', 'trekking', 'potential', 'asserting', 'mineral', 'commitment', 'framework', 'choose', 'tech', 'hon', 'permit', 'development', 'device', 'million', 'tax', 'legal', 'country', 'best', 'executive', 'national', 'longterm', 'interest', 'forming', 'according', 'site', 'betty', 'encourage', 'aim', 'kuala', 'industrial', 'growing', 'day', 'offering', 'strategic', 'processing', 'next', 'includes', 'various', 'industry', 'land', 'malaysia', 'opening', 'crude', 'supply', 'across', 'rich', 'beneficiation', 'high', 'addition', 'program', 'matia', 'commissioner', 'ict', 'single', 'untapped', 'strong', 'common', 'expected', 'olive', 'pipeline', 'fertile', 'stretch', 'refining', 'africa', 'pearl', 'international', 'kasaija', 'extraction', 'opportunity', 'heritage', 'economic', 'ecolodges', 'key', 'highlevel', 'ugandan', 'drawing', 'bridge', 'business', 'facilitation', 'drive', 'refinery', 'delegate', 'association', 'player', 'creation', 'unveiled', 'two', 'partnership', 'investor', 'adventure', 'position', 'hub', 'profit', 'private', 'friendly', 'region', 'targeting', 'bolster', 'authority', 'kigongo', 'global', 'profiled', 'attracted', 'gain', 'access', 'agroprocessing', 'integration', 'kidepo', 'agricultural', 'presidential', 'portfolio', 'mechanization', 'noting', 'exist', 'government', 'broader', 'highimpact', 'alpine', 'local', 'storage', 'eac', 'notable', 'delegation', 'president', 'training', 'project', 'established', 'bhg', 'ambitious', 'copper', 'muhtar', 'uganda', 'optimism', 'meeting', 'ownership', 'critical', 'queen', 'including', 'assembly', 'particularly', 'bigombe', 'welcomed', 'trade', 'gas', 'safeguard', 'dont', 'chain', 'energy', 'elizabeth', 'offer', 'gold', 'supportive', 'park', 'serve', 'range', 'shape', 'liberal', 'muhwezi', 'highlighted', 'launched', 'benefit', 'publicprivate', 'estimated', 'encouraged', 'fall', 'animal', 'technology', 'open', 'agribusiness', 'green', 'digitizing', 'gateway', 'joint', 'twoday', 'raw', 'among', 'cobalt', 'support', 'exemption', 'inviting', 'ambassador', 'confirmed', 'custom', 'petroleum', 'tourism', 'climate', 'attention', 'strategy', 'five', 'community', 'repatriation', 'finance', 'asian', 'wildlife', 'ssentongo', 'agroindustrialisation', 'favorable', 'valley', 'yang', 'ban', 'powerhouse', 'bilateral', 'many', 'southern', 'ensures', 'onestop', 'earth', 'postharvest', 'usd', 'smelting', 'eastern', 'commerce', 'export', 'iron', 'graced', 'hashim', 'hoima', 'rare', 'bankable', 'invest', 'director', 'eacop', 'african', 'year', 'infrastructure', 'establishing', 'unlocking', 'tap', 'senior', 'progress', 'boast', 'venture', 'also', 'forum', 'bright', 'rapidly', 'area', 'duty', 'regional', 'science', 'ceremony', 'state', 'cornerstone', 'ore', 'mountain', 'discussion', 'incentive', 'described', 'youth', 'competitive', 'natural', 'chemical', 'susan', 'emphasized', 'ideal', 'comesa', 'noted', 'leading', 'unlock', 'exploring', 'positioning', 'rwamirama', 'creating', 'deepening', 'innovation', 'theme', 'expo', 'company', 'field', 'growth', 'nankabirwa', 'east', 'flagship', 'foreign', 'followup', 'chamber', 'chief', 'said', 'expressed', 'billion', 'sustainable', 'consumer', 'zone']",Positive

“This is in view of global developments that reflect increasing uncertainty in the international trade landscape, including changes in policies among major world markets that directly impact the rubber supply chain and export market,” said the ministry.

“These circumstances may lead to a rise in rubber glove imports, which could affect the competitiveness of the domestic rubber industry.”

Malaysia is among the world’s top producers and exporters of rubber and rubber-based products; exports amounted to RM33 billion in 2024, of which rubber gloves contributed RM15.4 billion (45.8%).

The ministry said the rubber board has strengthened oversight of the industry in view of the ongoing global trade challenges, including tightening export licensing requirements and carrying out enhanced monitoring and enforcement.

The move comes in the wake of the US imposing a general tariff of 10% on imports from all countries, and special tariffs on about 60 countries, suspended for 90 days. Malaysia was hit with a 24% tariff rate.

Bloomberg reported yesterday that US-based online traders importing goods from China had received numerous suspicious offers for routing the goods through a country with lower tariff rates than China or falsifying shipment values.",1.7457E+12,en,-0.296031624,2025-04-25 14:32:00,"['rule', 'lead', 'strengthened', 'online', 'hit', 'glove', 'carrying', 'supply', 'china', 'amounted', 'sustainability', 'including', 'policy', 'tightening', 'exporter', 'import', 'rubberbased', 'falsifying', 'export', 'diversion', 'imposing', 'rubber', 'market', 'trade', 'contributed', 'wake', 'move', 'board', 'uncertainty', 'chain', 'licensed', 'offer', 'domestic', 'suspended', 'world', 'change', 'value', 'may', 'malaysian', 'circumstance', 'could', 'come', 'trader', 'international', 'monitoring', 'increasing', 'good', 'enhanced', 'affect', 'special', 'shipment', 'plantation', 'major', 'today', 'ministry', 'prevent', 'rise', 'enforcement', 'petaling', 'produced', 'impact', 'view', 'challenge', 'numerous', 'requirement', 'routing', 'lower', 'product', 'bloomberg', 'statement', 'among', 'landscape', 'tariff', 'usbased', 'commodity', 'development', 'nation', 'jaya', 'measure', 'global', 'bernama', 'manufacturer', 'country', 'becoming', 'suspicious', 'pic', 'ensure', 'able', 'reported', 'made', 'licensing', 'received', 'reflect', 'competitiveness', 'government', 'yesterday', 'directly', 'rate', 'day', 'ongoing', 'importing', 'local', 'top', 'industry', 'malaysia', 'producer', 'said', 'billion', 'general', 'new', 'destination', 'oversight']",Neutral

MELAKA, April 25 (Bernama) -- Melaka will continue to honour the legacy and contributions made by Malaysia’s fifth Prime Minister, the late Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, particularly in relation to the development of the state. Governor Tun Dr Mohd Ali Mohd Rustam said that Tun Abdullah will be remembered as a leader with a people's spirit, calm in his approach, and always prioritising the nation's interests and the welfare of the people. “On behalf of the state government, the state assembly, and the people of Melaka, I express my deepest condolences to the entire family of the late Tun Abdullah following his passing on April 14.

“The death of Tun Abdullah is a great loss to the nation, as throughout his life, the statesman had made invaluable contributions to Malaysia’s development, particularly in fostering moderation, transparency, and unity among races both domestically and internationally.” He said this in his address when opening the First Meeting of the Fourth Term of the 15th Melaka State Assembly at Seri Negeri today. The current state assembly sitting will take place over three days, from today until April 29.

In his address, Tun Mohd Ali also highlighted the numerous initiatives spearheaded by the late former prime minister, including addressing flood issues by upgrading the drainage system to alleviate flash floods in the Melaka city area and securing funding for the beautification and cleaning of the Melaka River. “Taking into account the iconic slogan of Tun Abdullah - Cemerlang, Gemilang, and Terbilang - the state government has also built and named a building 'Kota Cemerlang' at MITC, Ayer Keroh,” he said.

Kota Kinabalu:

Sabah has awarded all necessary projects to achieve its 40 per cent renewable energy target by 2030, according to Energy Commission of Sabah (ECoS) Chief Executive Officer Datuk Abdul Nasser Abdul Wahid.

“This puts Sabah on a definitive path to transform its power grid,” he said at the closing of the Sabah Renewable Energy Conference 2025 (SAREC 2025), jointly organised by Qhazanah Sabah Berhad and Malaysian Rating Corporation Berhad at Shangri-La Tanjung Aru, Thursday.

Abdul Nasser said the secured projects position Sabah to potentially exceed its goals, with 50 per cent sustainable energy capacity now projected by 2035, five years ahead of the original 2040 timeline.

“Up to 2030, our targets are definitive because all required projects have been awarded, putting Sabah's initial 40 per cent renewable energy target on solid ground while creating room to accelerate the 50 per cent goal,” he said.

The transformation is anchored by the Sabah Energy Roadmap and Master Plan 2040 (SE-RAMP 2040), unveiled on Sept 19, 2023.

“We developed this comprehensive plan before assuming regulatory powers because we understood the importance of having a clear direction from day one,” he said.

The master plan outlines 16 strategic action plans with defined short, medium and long-term goals, complete with key performance indicators. “Some targets are ambitious, even tough, but necessary for Sabah's energy future,” he added.

On its three-pronged energy strategy, he said Sabah is implementing what it calls the energy triangle approach, namely, ensuring energy security through reliable power generation, promoting equal accessibility and affordability, particularly in rural areas and fostering environmental sustainability through clean energy solutions

“Unlike other places, we are not just focusing on affordability, accessibility remains our primary concern, especially for rural electrification,” he said.

He said Sabah’s energy transition agenda has been specifically tailored to the State's unique characteristics and available resources.

“Our approach differs from the National Energy Transition Roadmap. We have developed solutions that leverage Sabah's resources and address our specific challenges,” he said.

Current projections indicate Sabah could potentially reach its 50 per cent renewable energy target ahead of the 2035 schedule if all planned projects are implemented on time.

“We have built-in buffers, but with proper execution, we are confident of exceeding expectations,” he said.

He pointed out that achieving these goals requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders.

“This is not a task for any single entity. We need government agencies, industry players, investors and communities working together,” he said.

Additionally, he noted the unprecedented cooperation seen at SAREC 2025, where competing firms came together for Sabah's benefit.

“We witnessed competitors united by a common purpose, that is the spirit we need moving forward,” he said.

He said the energy transition presents opportunities for economic growth and innovation.

“The challenges are real, but they bring huge potential for job creation, technological advancement and community empowerment,” he said, adding that they are actively working to create an enabling environment through policy improvements and investment incentives.

“We are committed to establishing Sabah as not just a national leader in renewable energy, but a regional example.

“This is more than just ambition, it is our collective responsibility. Together, we will build the energy future Sabah deserves,” he said.",1.7457E+12,en,0.233131513,2025-04-25 23:37:25,"['per', 'time', 'execution', 'huge', 'assuming', 'meeting', 'thursday', 'clean', 'awarded', 'original', 'sustainability', 'putting', 'generation', 'policy', 'grid', 'particularly', 'berhad', 'developed', 'tailored', 'comprehensive', 'cooperation', 'pointed', 'build', 'tough', 'expectation', 'task', 'threepronged', 'real', 'ensuring', 'present', 'collective', 'security', 'namely', 'unique', 'single', 'cent', 'projection', 'specific', 'common', 'committed', 'officer', 'conference', 'energy', 'direction', 'confident', 'competing', 'firm', 'plan', 'secured', 'investment', 'unlike', 'bring', 'year', 'concerted', 'required', 'rating', 'performance', 'establishing', 'transformation', 'planned', 'requires', 'leader', 'added', 'unprecedented', 'complete', 'current', 'malaysian', 'sarec', 'responsibility', 'spirit', 'together', 'could', 'advertisement', 'solid', 'kota', 'sept', 'primary', 'power', 'achieving', 'opportunity', 'projected', 'economic', 'transform', 'moving', 'affordability', 'understood', 'transition', 'definitive', 'accessibility', 'improvement', 'area', 'aru', 'kinabalu', 'key', 'address', 'ecos', 'call', 'leverage', 'regional', 'qhazanah', 'remains', 'schedule', 'builtin', 'agenda', 'path', 'especially', 'seramp', 'stakeholder', 'working', 'one', 'united', 'electrification', 'room', 'potential', 'medium', 'renewable', 'benefit', 'state', 'player', 'place', 'creation', 'target', 'datuk', 'entity', 'clear', 'unveiled', 'abdul', 'challenge', 'incentive', 'investor', 'master', 'position', 'sponsored', 'competitor', 'commission', 'differs', 'characteristic', 'future', 'closing', 'organised', 'purpose', 'accelerate', 'agency', 'specifically', 'achieve', 'noted', 'necessary', 'reliable', 'effort', 'ambition', 'actively', 'timeline', 'wahid', 'environmental', 'job', 'fostering', 'empowerment', 'adding', 'need', 'implementing', 'defined', 'create', 'short', 'action', 'triangle', 'outline', 'regulatory', 'indicate', 'creating', 'example', 'innovation', 'capacity', 'nasser', 'additionally', 'implemented', 'roadmap', 'executive', 'shangrila', 'strategy', 'potentially', 'national', 'ahead', 'ground', 'approach', 'jointly', 'five', 'longterm', 'growth', 'community', 'solution', 'according', 'concern', 'enabling', 'initial', 'government', 'buffer', 'tanjung', 'deserves', 'content', 'equal', 'day', 'technological', 'environment', 'goal', 'came', 'strategic', 'witnessed', 'importance', 'forward', 'put', 'sabah', 'available', 'chief', 'reach', 'focusing', 'corporation', 'proper', 'advancement', 'rural', 'industry', 'exceed', 'said', 'project', 'exceeding', 'indicator', 'even', 'sustainable', 'seen', 'ambitious', 'cue', 'anchored', 'resource', 'promoting']",Neutral

Kota Kinabalu:

Sabah’s economic prospects remain robust despite global uncertainties and domestic challenges, said MARC Ratings Berhad Chief Economist Ray Choy See Yew during the Sabah Renewable Energy Conference (Sarec) 2025 here, on Thursday.

Presenting on the theme “Economic and Market Outlook for 2025 and Beyond”, Choy said the outlook for the year ahead remains cautious, largely due to persistent global trade tensions.

However, he assured that Malaysia’s economy, driven predominantly by domestic demand, is well-positioned to weather external shocks.

“Malaysia’s economy is essentially domestically driven. Approximately two-thirds of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) comes from internal demand, which offers a strong buffer against external shocks like trade wars,” he said.

SPONSORED CONTENT

He also underlined the strength of Malaysia’s diversified export base. While the United States (US) remains a key trade partner, no single country accounts for more than 10 percent of Malaysia’s export-to-GDP ratio — a sign of the country’s resilience in the face of global headwinds.

“Sabah’s contribution to Malaysia’s GDP, though vital, has slightly declined over the years, from 6 percent in 2013 to 5.3 percent in 2023,” he said.

Despite this dip, Choy believes Sabah has substantial growth potential, especially in light of its GDP growth of just 1.3 percent in 2023 — below the national average of 3.7 percent.

“While Sabah continues to develop, there is still ample opportunity to improve and grow its economic output,” he said.

He remarked that services, mining, and agriculture remain the backbone of the State economy, with ongoing diversification offering new pathways for development.

Choy also pointed out that Sabah’s median wage growth has outpaced the national trend — increasing from RM1,300 in 2013 to RM2,015 in 2022 — compared to the national rise from RM1,700 to RM2,424.

“Sabah’s wage growth of 5 percent per annum is above the national average of 4 percent, indicating improving living standards in the State,” Choy said.

While Sabah continues to lead the nation in palm oil production, challenges such as climate change and limited replanting have impacted output.

“However, palm oil continues to be a vital export, alongside petroleum products and natural gas, which together make up half of the State’s total exports,” he added.

Highlighting Sabah’s future, Choy spoke of transformative projects set to diversify and stimulate the local economy — particularly in renewable energy, infrastructure, and agriculture.

“Key projects include Seguntor Bioenergy Sdn Bhd (RM80 million to RM120 million) and the Tadau Energy Solar Farm, Malaysia’s first green sukuk-financed renewable energy initiative, valued at RM250 million.

“Renewable energy projects are central to Sabah’s growth and offer exciting prospects for long-term economic stability,” he said.

He also emphasised the strategic importance of major infrastructure initiatives such as the RM40 billion Pan Borneo Highway and the RM7.5 billion Sabah-Sarawak Link Road (SSLR).

“These infrastructure projects are pivotal for Sabah’s future economic growth,” he said, adding that enhanced transportation networks will strengthen both local and regional development.

Nationally, Choy projected a 4.4 percent GDP growth for Malaysia in this year, supported by stable inflation, steady foreign direct investment in semiconductors and data infrastructure and a resilient financial market.

On the global front, he forecast 2.8 percent economic growth for the year, with inflation expected to ease. However, he warned that US tariffs and changing global trade dynamics could still pose risks — particularly for Asean economies.

“Trade war dynamics are constantly evolving and US tariffs could shift the economic landscape,” he said.

KUCHING, April 24 (Bernama) -- The rich arts and cultural heritage of ASEAN countries offer immense potential for further growth, said Malaysia's Tourism, Arts and Culture Minister Datuk Seri Tiong King Sing. He said in recent years, ASEAN has not only advanced economically but also witnessed a growing recognition of its arts and cultural heritage. This unique heritage has emerged as one of the most promising avenues for driving inclusive growth, creating jobs, empowering local communities, and preserving the grouping's rich traditions, he noted.

bootstrap slideshow “From ancient crafts to contemporary art, from indigenous festivals to culinary legacies — our cultural assets are living expressions of our identity and shared history,” he said in his speech during the 33rd ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community (ASCC) Council Meeting opening ceremony here, today. Tiong said by strengthening cross border collaborations, curating immersive arts and cultural experiences and integrating storytelling into tourism strategies, ASEAN can offer the world something truly unique. “Together, let us champion a tourism model that not only attracts visitors but also uplifts the soul of our nations and sustains our arts and cultural legacies for generations to come.

“Our journey ahead requires renewed commitment and cooperation as we continue to face global challenges under our pillar, which includes public health crises, climate change, sudden shifts in international affairs and economic disparities and social welfare,” he said. The ongoing ASCC Council Meeting is a biannual ministerial-level gathering focused on addressing key socio-cultural issues across the ASEAN region.

Kota Kinabalu:

The implementation of the Food Systems, Land Use and Restoration (Folur) Programme in Sabah has placed the State on the global map, alongside 27 other countries, under the international Folur initiative.

Chief Minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor said through collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the Folur project — centred on Integrated Landscape Management — covers an area of approximately 2.38 million hectares across 12 districts in Sabah, and is expected to benefit around 54,000 rural residents.

He said the Folur project is a significant step in Sabah’s efforts to strike a balance between agricultural development and environmental conservation, as the State moves towards a more sustainable, efficient and inclusive food system.

“This project promotes sustainable agricultural practices, particularly in the palm oil sector, while also restoring degraded forest areas. It allows us to reduce pressure on forest ecosystems while ensuring food security and income sources for the people of Sabah,” he said at the launch of the 2025 Sabah-level International Day of Forests at the grounds of the Faculty of Tropical Forestry, Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS), Thursday.

His speech was delivered by State Industrial Development and Entrepreneurship Minister Datuk Phoong Jin Zhe.

Hajiji said in the long term, this initiative will support climate goals, as forests play a vital role in combating climate change through carbon absorption. Folur will contribute to Sabah’s commitment to climate action, biodiversity conservation and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 15: “Life on Land.”

He added that the State Forestry Department is currently drafting a Statewide Forest Master Plan, which will outline strategies for managing forest resources over the next 25 years, covering forested areas throughout the State.

Through this plan, all Ecologically Sensitive Areas will continue to be protected, while socio-economic development that improves the well-being of Sabahans will also move forward.

This aligns with the implementation of the Sabah Maju Jaya (SMJ) Development Plan 1.0 (2021–2025), which integrates infrastructure development with a focus on green growth.

Hajiji said the Sabah Climate Action Council (SCAC), established by the State Government, acts as an advisory body and serves as a platform for consultation and policy coordination related to climate change. Several key initiatives have already been implemented, including setting strategic directions and coordinating climate change mitigation and adaptation projects at the State level.

He added that given the forestry sector’s crucial role in addressing climate change, a Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Unit has been established within the Sabah Forestry Department.

“Through SCAC, Sabah continues to strengthen its position as a leader in progressive, sustainability-focused environmental governance,” he said.

Hajiji said a Climate Change Impact, Vulnerability and Adaptation Study was conducted in 2024, and this will serve as a reference for drafting the Sabah Climate Change Policy to ensure alignment with national climate action developments.

As a state with low carbon emissions, Hajiji said Sabah can leverage this position to venture into a low-carbon economy, as it has the potential to develop with minimal energy and resource requirements, thereby reducing its climate impact.

He also said Sabah is in the process of finalising its State Climate Change Policy, which is based on the principles of good governance, a just transition, resilience and sustainable economic growth, in line with Malaysia’s Climate Change Policy 2.0.

“In tandem with the development of this policy, Sabah will also be drafting a Climate Change Enactment to align with the development of the National Climate Change Bill (RUUPIN), which is currently being finalised at the federal level,” Hajiji said.

Touching on the recent amendments to the Forest Enactment, he said forest-based carbon activities will be regulated under specific terms and conditions, and any revenue or funds generated from forest carbon credit activities will be channelled directly to the State.

He said this is important to support the Sabah Government’s efforts in achieving a balance between socio-economic development and environmental conservation in the future.

Hajiji asserted that all climate change-related activities in Sabah, including carbon markets, must be registered, monitored, analysed and reported to SCAC, as the focal point for the State’s climate agenda.

From Salawaty Supardi LONDON, April 26 (Bernama) -- The government is adopting the approach of constructing multi-purpose reservoirs as part of its efforts to mitigate floods in the country and reduce losses caused by natural disasters, said Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Fadillah Yusof. Fadillah, who is also the Minister of Energy Transition and Water Transformation, explained that these reservoirs will not only store large volumes of rainwater but also serve as a vital water source during dry seasons.

“The reservoirs will enable us to reserve water for use during droughts, ensuring a stable supply. The stored water can then be treated and distributed for various needs, whether for drinking, agriculture, industry, or other uses. This is one of the strategies we are implementing,” he said at a dinner with Malaysians in the United Kingdom (UK) at the Malaysian High Commission here Friday. It was attended by about 80 people, including students, employees of government-linked companies, and staff of the Malaysian High Commission in London. Also present were Malaysian High Commissioner to the UK and Northern Ireland Datuk Zakri Jaafar, Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) Chief New Energy Officer Mohd Zarihi Mohd Hashim, Sarawak Energy Berhad Group Chief Executive Officer Datuk Sharbini Suhaili and a delegation from the Ministry of Energy Transition and Water Transformation (PETRA)

During his visit, Fadillah led the Malaysian delegation to the Summit of the Future of Energy Security held at Lancaster House, which was held for two days starting Friday.

From Salawaty Supardi LONDON, April 26 (Bernama) -- The government is adopting the approach of constructing multi-purpose reservoirs as part of its efforts to mitigate floods in the country and reduce losses caused by natural disasters, said Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Fadillah Yusof. Fadillah, who is also the Minister of Energy Transition and Water Transformation, explained that these reservoirs will not only store large volumes of rainwater but also serve as a vital water source during dry seasons.

“The reservoirs will enable us to reserve water for use during droughts, ensuring a stable supply. The stored water can then be treated and distributed for various needs, whether for drinking, agriculture, industry, or other uses. This is one of the strategies we are implementing,” he said at a dinner with Malaysians in the United Kingdom (UK) at the Malaysian High Commission here Friday. It was attended by about 80 people, including students, employees of government-linked companies, and staff of the Malaysian High Commission in London. Also present were Malaysian High Commissioner to the UK and Northern Ireland Datuk Zakri Jaafar, Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) Chief New Energy Officer Mohd Zarihi Mohd Hashim, Sarawak Energy Berhad Group Chief Executive Officer Datuk Sharbini Suhaili and a delegation from the Ministry of Energy Transition and Water Transformation (PETRA)

Fadillah, who arrived here from Turkiye on Wednesday for a three-day working visit, earlier performed Friday prayers with the Malaysian Muslim community at Malaysia Hall. During his visit, Fadillah led the Malaysian delegation to the Summit of the Future of Energy Security held at Lancaster House, which was held for two days starting Friday. Elaborating further, Fadillah said that flood mitigation efforts must be carried out urgently, as significant climate change is currently affecting Malaysia’s weather patterns, leading to various natural disasters, including floods caused by intense rainfall.",1.74567E+12,en,0.045755886,2025-04-26 02:56:23,"['store', 'rainfall', 'deputy', 'minister', 'flood', 'staff', 'supply', 'mitigation', 'intense', 'high', 'including', 'suhaili', 'berhad', 'disaster', 'tenaga', 'turkiye', 'commissioner', 'ensuring', 'present', 'season', 'hashim', 'yusof', 'seri', 'security', 'mohd', 'agriculture', 'use', 'officer', 'energy', 'friday', 'dry', 'performed', 'governmentlinked', 'vital', 'drinking', 'pattern', 'urgently', 'source', 'reservoir', 'prayer', 'change', 'transformation', 'must', 'stored', 'petra', 'held', 'malaysian', 'employee', 'mitigate', 'weather', 'constructing', 'serve', 'supardi', 'salawaty', 'also', 'caused', 'transition', 'muslim', 'threeday', 'student', 'stable', 'starting', 'wednesday', 'working', 'one', 'united', 'group', 'jaafar', 'ministry', 'explained', 'earlier', 'fadillah', 'loss', 'datuk', 'northern', 'sarawak', 'significant', 'treated', 'rainwater', 'kingdom', 'led', 'lancaster', 'volume', 'two', 'commission', 'ireland', 'natural', 'distributed', 'visit', 'future', 'elaborating', 'water', 'effort', 'house', 'leading', 'affecting', 'bernama', 'nasional', 'need', 'implementing', 'sharbini', 'country', 'london', 'drought', 'enable', 'dinner', 'attended', 'people', 'hall', 'executive', 'strategy', 'climate', 'company', 'approach', 'adopting', 'large', 'community', 'carried', 'summit', 'part', 'government', 'zarihi', 'reduce', 'zakri', 'day', 'arrived', 'whether', 'chief', 'april', 'various', 'industry', 'multipurpose', 'delegation', 'malaysia', 'said', 'currently', 'prime', 'tnb', 'new', 'reserve']",Neutral

ZHENGZHOU, China, April 24, 2025 /CNW/ — Yutong Bus (“Yutong”, SHA: 600066), a commercial vehicle manufacturer from Asia, unveiled a landmark achievement in its Net Zero Forest initiative during the 2025 World Earth Day celebrations. As part of its long-term sustainability strategy and ESG-driven corporate social responsibility (CSR) framework, Yutong commits to plant one tree globally for every bus added to the fleet, forging a tangible link between commercial success and environmental stewardship. Building on its 2024 achievements of planting over 36,000 trees in regions including China, Chile, and the UK, the company aims to scale reforestation efforts to 47,000 trees in 2025, with a decade-long roadmap to expand globally.

The Net Zero Forest initiative is designed to address climate change through a Double Carbon model: accelerating the adoption of zero-emission buses while restoring ecosystems via strategic afforestation. By aligning each vehicle sale with direct environmental action, Yutong creates a transparent, sustainable value chain that engages customers, partners, and communities in collective climate efforts.

“Sustainability is not just a goal for Yutong. It’s embedded in our DNA through our corporate commitment to Think Eco, Move Green,” said Jason Huang, Global Brand Director of Yutong Bus. “Linking every bus on the road to measurable ecological impact allows us to visualize the journey from vehicle production to carbon reduction.”

The 2025 campaign will focus on regions facing urgent ecological challenges with tailored solutions to address local needs. Each project is supported by Yutong’s TEAM ZERO Alliance, a coalition of over 40 global new energy bus operators committed to advancing carbon neutrality. Key innovations underpin the program’s success:

“Double Carbon” Model: Combining clean transportation with afforestation to reduce fossil fuel reliance and enhance natural carbon sinks.

Long-Term Commitment: A 10-year roadmap to plant millions of trees across the globe, ensuring lasting environmental and social impact.

Tech-Driven Accountability: Digital tools like carbon footprint tracking quantify emission reductions, ensuring data-driven optimization.

Yutong’s unwavering commitment to green leadership fuels its mission to reshape global public transportation through decarbonization and enduring sustainability. Since 2021, Yutong has championed global climate action. At COP26, it showcased zero-emission public transport solutions for the UK. In 2023, its E12 electric bus earned dual certifications from the UK’s Zemo Partnership and UTAC, validating compliance with European standards for energy efficiency and carbon emissions. The 2024 Green Mobility Week in Australia further galvanized public engagement in low-carbon commuting.

The Net Zero Forest initiative builds on this legacy. Since its 2024 pilot, the program delivered localized benefits by halting desertification in Gansu, revitalizing urban ecosystems in the UK, and rehabilitating climate-affected forests in Chile. Beyond ecological gains, the initiative spurs green job creation, advocates for electrified public transit policies, and cements Yutong’s reputation as a sustainability trailblazer.

In an interview granted to the Vietnam News Agency, Anh said that the 50-year journey that the two countries have taken is marked with an important milestone when they lifted their ties to a strategic partnership on August 7, 2015, making Vietnam the only strategic partner of Malaysia among the ASEAN countries.

The upgrade showed the in-depth development of the bilateral relations with strong political trust, while reflecting a new chapter in their comprehensive cooperation over all fields such as politics, diplomacy, economy, trade, culture, defence-security, science-technology and sustainable development, she said.

The two sides are currently working together to implement the Action Plan to realise their strategic partnership in the 2021-2025 period, paving the way for the further growth of the bilateral relations in the future.

Anh noted that over many years, Malaysia has been one of the leading trade and investment partner of Vietnam among the ASEAN member states.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the two sides still maintained the exchange of delegations and high-level meetings through all channels in flexible forms, including the Vietnam visit by then Malaysian Prime Minister Dato Sri Ismail Sabri Yaakob in March 2022, said the diplomat, adding that bilateral cooperation mechanisms have also been maintained and promoted.

At the same time, the two sides have strengthened defence and security cooperation through high-level meetings. The signing of the cooperation agreement on transnational crime prevention and combat in 2015 created an important legal foundation for the two sides to promote their collaboration in the field of national security protection, she said.

The diplomat highlighted the economic-trade cooperation as a bright spot in the bilateral relations over the years. Malaysia is currently the second biggest trade partner in the ASEAN only after Thailand, and ranks ninth among all the trade partners of Vietnam in the world. Malaysia is also the third largest export market of Vietnam in the ASEAN. Two-way trade has continuously increased through years despite the pandemic impact, reaching 14.7 billion USD in 2022, up 17.6% year on year.

Malaysia is Vietnam's second largest investor in the ASEAN after Singapore, and ranks 10th out of the 140 countries and territories investing in Vietnam with 668 valid projects totalling 13 billion USD. Meanwhile, Vietnam has 21 investment projects in Malaysia with a total registered capital of 853 million USD.

Both sides are members of many organisations, forums and free trade agreements (FTA), including the ASEAN Plus free trade area, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), Anh highlighted, underlining that the two countries are enjoying huge cooperation potential.

Regarding major focuses in the partnership between the two countries in 2023 and following years, Anh said that the two sides will collaborate in promoting the effective implementation of the Action Plan to realise their strategic partnership in the 2021-2025 period, with special attention to the maintenance of political trust and exchange of delegations at high and all levels through all channels, and the promotion of economic cooperation, creating favourable conditions for the bilateral collaboration in new and potential areas such as Halal industry and digital transformation.

At the same time, it is necessary to facilitate bilateral cooperation mechanisms such as the Joint Committee on economic, science and technology cooperation at the FM level, and the Joint Committee on trade cooperation at the Industry and Trade ministerial level, thus realising development goals in particular fields, she said.

In terms of economic cooperation, leaders of the two countries have agreed to work together towards the target of 18 billion USD in two-way trade in 2025.

As the two countries have reopened their tourism market, they should resume connections in this sector, people-to-people exchange, education and labour, Anh held, adding that Malaysia is a potential tourism and investment market of Vietnam.

Halal food industry is also a promising cooperation area for the two sides, as Malaysia is one of the leading countries in building standards that can help Vietnamese goods access the Malaysian market and other Islamic countries in the Middle East and other parts of the world.

The diplomat also revealed that in the time to come, the Vietnamese Embassy will coordinate with relevant ministries and agencies of Vietnam and the host country to organise various activities to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam-Malaysia diplomatic relations, including a ceremony to mark the event, which comprises of a meeting, a food festival and art performances.

Commenting on the contributions of the Vietnamese community in Malaysia, Anh said that currently, there are more than 30,000 Vietnamese people living, working and studying in Malaysia. Along with making important contributions to the host economy, the community has maintained and promoted the Vietnamese culture in Malaysia and engaged in many charity and social activities in the host country, while working as a bridge connecting people of the two nations, she said./.

The Home Minister said the acquisition will take place on April 28 and it is Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim’s wish to address integrity issues after receiving reports from the Immigration director-general.

“He (Anwar) wants body-worn cameras to be used and when the director-general informed me, I immediately asked the ministry secretary-general to expedite this.

“The acquisition will take place on April 28 and we will prepare 600 (body-worn cameras). God-willing, we can solve more integrity cases,” said Saifuddin during his opening speech at the Home Ministry’s Hari Raya Aidilfitri reception on Thursday (April 24).

Saifuddin said Anwar has always emphasised the importance of professionalism among the enforcement agencies.

Meanwhile, Saifuddin said that beginning June, the manual counters of a majority of airports nationwide will be replaced with autogates in order to reduce congestion.

“The autogates will make travel even quicker,” added Saifuddin.

At the same time, Saifuddin said that during a ministerial awards ceremony for outstanding services on April 23, he had relayed Anwar’s message of appreciation to the Home Ministry staff for their service during the recent official visit of China’s President Xi Jinping.

“Anwar said he was deeply humbled and if we can maintain this momentum, god-willing, the Prime Minister’s wishes of seeing the country being uplifted will be realised,” added Saifuddin.

Over 7,000 body-worn cameras were rolled out for use at 157 district police headquarters and 640 police stations nationwide this year.

Aside from the police, Road Transport Department (JPJ) enforcement officers also started using 100 body-worn cameras this year.

The use of body-worn cameras on enforcement officers aims to reduce corruption and to address integrity issues among personnel. — THE STAR/ANN",1.74561E+12,en,0.279115796,2025-04-25 02:41:00,"['minister', 'receiving', 'time', 'staff', 'thursday', 'china', 'anwars', 'road', 'jinping', 'ibrahim', 'camera', 'say', 'secretarygeneral', 'aside', 'seri', 'station', 'quicker', 'use', 'officer', 'integrity', 'putrajaya', 'june', 'travel', 'message', 'airport', 'nationwide', 'year', 'directorgeneral', 'added', 'nasution', 'autogates', 'informed', 'bodyworn', 'replaced', 'ministerial', 'majority', 'also', 'uplifted', 'realised', 'official', 'relayed', 'address', 'emphasised', 'ceremony', 'used', 'ministry', 'professionalism', 'momentum', 'place', 'hari', 'enforcement', 'meanwhile', 'datuk', 'set', 'acquisition', 'personnel', 'appreciation', 'award', 'starann', 'issue', 'make', 'maintain', 'prepare', 'rolled', 'speech', 'visit', 'district', 'case', 'among', 'deeply', 'agency', 'bid', 'saifuddin', 'jpj', 'service', 'transport', 'country', 'corruption', 'raya', 'wish', 'acquire', 'order', 'congestion', 'asked', 'headquarters', 'expedite', 'report', 'godwilling', 'reception', 'started', 'outstanding', 'immigration', 'recent', 'aim', 'aidilfitri', 'want', 'always', 'manual', 'reduce', 'anwar', 'take', 'solve', 'counter', 'immediately', 'home', 'importance', 'seeing', 'april', 'department', 'said', 'president', 'police', 'opening', 'beginning', 'prime', 'even', 'using', 'ismail', 'humbled']",Neutral

In a statement on Saturday, Iskandar said his Facebook posts were intended merely to highlight the participation of several Muslim candidates from Singapore's opposition parties, as well as a young Muslim candidate from the ruling People's Action Party (PAP).

“I was only reporting on a few notable Muslim candidates contesting from opposition parties. I also uploaded a video of a young Muslim PAP candidate introducing himself to voters,” he said.

His remarks come in response to a statement by Singapore's Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), which directed Meta to restrict access to several online election advertisements (OEAs) allegedly posted by foreign individuals, including two PAS leaders.

Singaporean media reports had named Iskandar and Selangor PAS Youth Chief Mohamed Sukri Omar as being identified in connection with the alleged interference.

Iskandar clarified that his Facebook content was predominantly intended for a Malaysian Muslim audience.

“Although some of my posts were written in English, they were aimed at Malaysians, not voters across the Causeway,” he said.

“I never called on anyone to vote along racial or religious lines. I did express hope that some of these Muslim candidates would win, but I do not know them personally and have never met them,” he added.

The former PAS vice-president stressed that he had never incited Singaporeans to vote based on race or religion, but was simply sharing his thoughts.

“As a politician, I think it is natural to follow and comment on political developments abroad,” he said.

He noted that he had previously commented extensively on UK politics and even hoped for a Labour Party win, but that had not drawn accusations of election interference.

“I’ve written about other countries without issue. That’s why this feels extraordinary,” he said.

Iskandar also said he was puzzled by the decision to restrict his Facebook content in Singapore.

“I don’t think my Facebook page is particularly influential, even in Malaysia. So I was really surprised when it was blocked and became inaccessible in Singapore,” he said.

He raised concerns that the move might be politically motivated.

“I still wonder what the real purpose behind the restriction is. I hope it’s not an attempt to link my party to Singapore’s opposition—that would be a very serious accusation,” he said.

He emphasised that he respects Singapore’s democratic system and has no intention of interfering in its political affairs.

“I urge everyone not to jump to conclusions without understanding the full context. Accusations like this only create confusion and distract from healthy political discourse,” he said. - April 26, 2025",1.74569E+12,en,-0.25361985,2025-04-26 06:45:00,"['full', 'online', 'audience', 'named', 'allegedly', 'across', 'serious', 'express', 'uploaded', 'opposition', 'remark', 'including', 'became', 'upcoming', 'particularly', 'incited', 'video', 'pap', 'directed', 'race', 'saturday', 'meta', 'oppositionthat', 'respect', 'oeas', 'real', 'reporting', 'surprised', 'influential', 'inaccessible', 'context', 'ive', 'move', 'dont', 'social', 'iskandar', 'decision', 'wonder', 'intention', 'democratic', 'jump', 'religion', 'think', 'mohamed', 'infocomm', 'political', 'aimed', 'leader', 'introducing', 'added', 'hope', 'anyone', 'win', 'clarified', 'candidate', 'intended', 'malaysian', 'drawn', 'come', 'advertisement', 'participation', 'everyone', 'comment', 'causeway', 'restrict', 'individual', 'also', 'muslim', 'based', 'sharing', 'vote', 'restriction', 'treasurergeneral', 'feel', 'claim', 'emphasised', 'facebook', 'thought', 'confusion', 'omar', 'although', 'politics', 'racial', 'medium', 'asserting', 'response', 'english', 'border', 'know', 'alleged', 'labour', 'datuk', 'party', 'samad', 'previously', 'called', 'might', 'met', 'issue', 'motivated', 'abdul', 'two', 'selangor', 'well', 'highlight', 'personally', 'predominantly', 'denied', 'without', 'expressing', 'youth', 'vicepresident', 'natural', 'sukri', 'never', 'merely', 'blocked', 'really', 'purpose', 'statement', 'discourse', 'religious', 'urge', 'interfere', 'interfering', 'noted', 'development', 'conclusion', 'distract', 'raised', 'puzzled', 'simply', 'written', 'allegation', 'authority', 'follow', 'attempted', 'abroad', 'create', 'country', 'election', 'action', 'accusation', 'identified', 'extraordinary', 'access', 'imda', 'young', 'posted', 'people', 'affair', 'politically', 'understanding', 'report', 'would', 'former', 'attempt', 'interference', 'connection', 'commented', 'concern', 'system', 'politician', 'ruling', 'thats', 'singaporean', 'link', 'behind', 'content', 'targeted', 'singapore', 'foreign', 'healthy', 'surprise', 'page', 'line', 'chief', 'voter', 'still', 'april', 'notable', 'several', 'malaysia', 'said', 'post', 'extensively', 'hoped', 'even', 'contesting', 'general', 'along', 'stressed', 'like']",Neutral

Malaysia is no exception.

The impending National Climate Change Bill—a comprehensive framework for national climate action—will serve as a cornerstone in aligning the country’s ambitions with its net-zero goal by 2050. This legislation is expected to significantly reshape the local business landscape, particularly for small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

Recognising the vital role of SMEs in this transition, Alliance Bank Malaysia Berhad (Alliance Bank, or the bank) conducted a survey to understand their awareness and adoption of sustainability and ESG practices.

The insights gathered were compiled into a landmark publication, The Path To Sustainable Impact: Sectoral Insights Of Malaysian SMEs, also known as the ESG 2.0 Report, which was officially launched on Jan 21 this year, in partnership with Monash University Malaysia and Zurich Malaysia.

The report is also supported by the United Nations Global Compact Malaysia and Brunei (UNGCMYB), Malaysian Green Technology and Climate Change Corporation (MGTC), SME Corporation Malaysia and INCEIF University.

This report highlights the level of awareness, adoption level of SMEs from four main sectors namely manufacturing, construction, service and agriculture as well as the challenges and recommendations dedicated to each sector.

The ESG 2.0 Report: A promising shift

The report reveals an encouraging rise in sustainability awareness among Malaysian SMEs—80% compared to 14% since the bank’s inaugural report – ESG Insights From Malaysia SMEs Building a Better Future Together or ESG 1.0 launched in 2023.

The increase is attributed to the collective efforts of stakeholders—including government bodies, corporates and media—who have worked together to amplify ESG awareness. The report highlights practical resources such as the ESG Quick Guide for MSMEs by SME Corp Malaysia, Capital Markets Malaysia’s Simplified ESG Disclosure Guide (SEDG) and MITI’s i-ESG Framework that have made ESG concepts more accessible and actionable for SMEs.

Besides regulatory compliance, the increase in adoption (from 28% to 60%) also stems from the realisation by businesses that ESG practices can achieve cost savings, efficiency improvements and also improved revenues. ESG adoption also results in new market opportunities, attracting more customers and enhancing resilience in an increasingly complex business landscape.

One of the key highlights in the report were the top three challenges when adopting ESG—the overwhelming amount of information and guidelines, the high costs of implementation and resource constraints. Despite the challenges listed, it is important to note that the proportion of SMEs with no intention of adopting ESG has dropped significantly from 41% to 14%.

Transforming barriers into business opportunities

As SMEs normally operate on tight budgets, small teams and limited resources, there are still challenges that have delayed or hindered their progress towards sustainability.

However, the rapid rise in embedding ESG practices into businesses demonstrates that SMEs are committed to adopting ESG through a “kaizen” approach without incurring significant capital expenditures.

By emphasising on small incremental changes and accessing cost-effective tools, training, financing as well as available ecosystems and partnerships, SMEs have started accelerating their ESG journey.

It is evident that SMEs are beginning to implement smart, pragmatic steps that reduce waste and cost—while improving ESG performance. For instance, a manufacturing company can retrofit their machineries to calibrate energy usage according to production cycles. This will help the company to reduce energy consumption which leads to immediate savings on the electricity bill.

Another example would be the installation of a compactor, by a steel processing SME, to compress lightweight shavings—previously considered unusable waste—into dense, recyclable blocks. It may be a modest investment however the impact was significant—where disposal cost is reduced, and additional income is generated via material resale.

The Alliance Bank advantage: A partner in every step

The report underscores a strong correlation between ESG adoption and business gains—including cost efficiency, market expansion and long-term resilience. But how can SMEs take the next step?

Alliance Bank supports SMEs with a holistic 3A Approach:

> Awareness: Through thought leadership initiatives like ESG surveys, sectoral playbooks, barometers, and this very ESG 2.0 Report, the bank fosters a deeper understanding of sustainable business practices.

> Advice: Alliance Bank provides expert guidance and tools, including the PROGRESS Climate Diagnostic Tool, co-developed with UNGCMYB. This dynamic tool helps businesses craft their climate reports and sustainability roadmaps which include steps mapped to their current stage of maturity. It also ties directly to Alliance Bank’s sustainability-linked funds.

> Answers: Beyond guidance, the bank provides tangible support through financing, services, providing linkages and curated ecosystem complete with pre-negotiated discounts. To date, Alliance Bank has helped over 1,000 businesses kick-start or accelerate their ESG journey.

Driven by its ambition to become a lifetime ESG-focused bank for SMEs, Alliance Bank is committed to helping businesses not only transition towards sustainable practices but also unlock new growth and future-proof their operations.

When most people think of vaccines, childhood immunisations — against measles, mumps or polio —often come to mind. However, in a rapidly aging Malaysia, where seniors are projected to outnumber children by 2050, immunisation must evolve into a lifelong public health strategy.

According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs 2024, Malaysia is undergoing a significant demographic shift with profound implications for its healthcare system. This transition underscores the urgent need to strengthen preventative care measures, particularly through adult immunisation.

Malaysia’s National Immunisation Programme (NIP), introduced in the 1950s as part of a maternal and child health initiative, currently offers free vaccines against 13 childhood diseases – more than double the original six recommended by the World Health Organization Expanded Programme on Immunisation. However, an additional seven recommended vaccines – covering illnesses such as chickenpox, dengue, COVID-19, hepatitis A, meningococcal disease, influenza and rotavirus – are only available at private healthcare facilities for a fee. This two-tiered system limits access for many adults, particularly the elderly.

Are Older Malaysians Being Left Behind?

While over 90% of Malaysian children are vaccinated against 13 diseases, adults and seniors remain vulnerable to various vaccine-preventable illnesses, such as influenza, pneumonia, and shingles. Influenza alone costs Malaysia RM3.3 billion annually in healthcare expenditures, primarily due to hospitalisations involving unvaccinated seniors. Meanwhile, cervical cancer remains the third-leading cause of cancer-related deaths among Malaysian women, despite the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine being free for teenage girls since 2010.

Demographic shifts pose additional challenges such as a shrinking workforce will struggle to support a growing elderly population, and a smaller tax base risks underfunding healthcare even as demand surges.

Globally, the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated immunisation gaps. A joint report by GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK) and IQVIA found that over 100 million adult vaccine doses were missed in 2021 and 2022 alone. Malaysia must urgently embrace a lifelong vaccination approach to bridge this gap and reduce future public health and economic burdens.

Why Lifelong Vaccination Matters

Vaccines are not only about preventing illness, but they also enable a better quality of life. In Malaysia, a modeling study found that implementing a national influenza immunisation programme for seniors could prevent over 66,000 influenza cases and more than 3,000 hospitalisations annually.

Among diabetics, flu shots reduce hospitalisation risk by 54%. Pneumococcal vaccines lower the risk of pneumonia by 41% in lung disease patients, and reduce mortality by 22% in adults with cardiovascular disease. Expanding HPV vaccination to include boys and men could accelerate progress toward eliminating cervical cancer altogether.

Despite the data, adult vaccination uptake remains low. A 2023 study found that while 47% of healthcare employees attributed sick leave to the flu, only 5% of seniors reported receiving the flu vaccine. The reasons are varied:

Policy Gaps: Adult vaccines are not included under the NIP. HPV coverage for girls stands at 52%, compared to 96% in Indonesia. Access Barriers: Rural clinics face stockouts, while urban adults may delay vaccines due to mobility or time constraints. Vaccine Hesitancy: Myths surrounding vaccine safety, adverse effects, and halal compliance persist. Misinformation and Pseudoscience Belief: Social media amplifies harmful myths, including belief in “homeopathic vaccines”. Healthcare Provider Gaps: Some healthcare practitioners lack training or willingness to advocate for adult vaccination, and may even perpetuate misinformation.

If unaddressed, these challenges could drive elderly healthcare costs in Malaysia to hit RM21 billion by 2040, with hospital admissions nearly double those of younger age groups.

Vaccines as a Lifelong Shield

To protect its aging population, Malaysia need a robust, cost-effective, and multi-pronged National Lifelong Vaccination Strategy that combines fiscal pragmatism with public trust. Key recommendations include:

Universal Access: Expand the NIP to cover essential adult vaccines (influenza, pneumococcal, and HPV for all genders), leveraging “sin taxes” on tobacco and sugary drinks or through public-private partnerships to subsidise vaccine dose costs. Transparency on Adverse Events: Launch a public-facing Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) dashboard to clarify facts and dispel myths. Electronic Immunisation Registry: Establish a centralised e-registry to track vaccination status and automate reminders for supplementary boosters. Public Awareness Campaigns: Train healthcare professionals to serve as vaccine advocates and collaborate with religious and community leaders to address halal concerns and misinformation. Corporate Accountability: Offer tax incentives for companies providing employee flu jabs as such programmes can save up to RM90.30 per worker annually in productivity gains.

As Malaysia approaches an aged population, vaccines must evolve from a childhood rite to a lifelong shield—an essential investment in national health, productivity, and resilience for every stage of life.

In waters as acidic as vinegar—at a pH of 4—a small, resilient fish known as the Malay combtail (Belontia hasselti), meanders gracefully through the dark, tea-stained pools of the peat swamp forest. These waters are coloured by tannins released by decomposing organic matter. They are surrounded by a dense canopy of leaves and littered with the remains of fallen trees and leaves.

Welcome to the world of peatlands— one of the most remarkable yet often overlooked ecosystems on Earth.

Peatlands exist in many forms around the globe—from the moors of the United Kingdom to bogs and fens of Minnesota to the swampy lowlands of the Congo Basin. Malaysia, particularly Sarawak, is home to some of the most unique tropical peat swamp forests, where the rainforest merges with the peatland to form a unique ecosystem.

These forests are home to a treasure trove of biodiversity, many of which are found nowhere else. The acidic and waterlogged conditions have given rise to highly specialised flora and fauna that makes these forests not only biologically rich but also ecologically irreplaceable.

“Peatlands are one of the most important carbon reservoirs,” said Sarawak Tropical Peat Research Institute (TROPI) director Datu Dr Lulie Melling.

In her research on tropical peatland ecosystems, Melling highlights that Malaysia’s peatlands—covering some 2.6 million hectares, 70% of which is in Sarawak—are still largely unexplored, despite being crucial for both biodiversity conservation and climate regulation. Melling’s research showed that the peat swamp forest is influenced by its topo-hydrological characteristics which influence the water movement, within the area.

These in turn determine the vegetation structure, species composition and peat type.

Nature’s sponge and climate regulator

According to Wetlands International Malaysia, Malaysian peat swamp forests are categorised as critically endangered forested wetlands. With their deep layers of peat that act like sponges, these forests play an important role in water regulation—absorbing excess rainfall to mitigate flooding and slowly releasing the water during dry spells.

Peat also acts as a natural filter, protecting the quality of fresh water and preventing seawater from entering coastal regions. Its acidic water dictates what can survive, creating a specialised ecosystem that differs from other tropical rainforests.

Although the tree species diversity is lower compared to the dipterocarp forests, the peat swamps harbour some of the world’s most important species.

These include the orangutan, Sumatran tiger, proboscis monkey and even the elusive Sumatran rhinoceros. Sarawak’s peat domes are also home to rare trees such as the Shorea albida, a species endemic to north-west Borneo.

Lifeline for local communities

For generations, peatland forests have provided for local and indigenous communities. These ecosystems provide fish, fruits, medicinal plants, honey and materials such as mengkuang and rattan for weaving and handicrafts. Traditional herbs such as Paku Miding, Seduduk, ribu gajah are used to treat diseases, reflecting the cultural and health value of these forests.

Carbon giants

What makes peatlands even more extraordinary is their role in mitigating climate change. Although they only cover 3% of the Earth’s land surface, peatlands store twice as much carbon as all the world’s forests combined. The tannins in the water slow down decomposition so that organic material can accumulate over thousands of years, storing huge amounts of carbon.

In fact, mummified cadavers from as far back as 8,000 years ago have been found in bogs around Europe, such as the Tollund Man in Denmark, which dated back to the Iron Age.

However, this natural carbon vault is fragile. As soon as the peat is drained or disturbed, it oxidises. This releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The dry peat material becomes highly flammable—fuel for wildfires and the dense haze that plagues South-East Asia.

Draining peatlands for agriculture or development not only threatens biodiversity but also undermines climate commitments and exposes low-lying areas to severe flooding.

Urgent call to conserve

There is an urgent need to preserve the remaining extensive tracts of peatland forests in Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak. According to Melling, expanding agricultural development and opening new settlements pose serious threats to these ecologically rich landscapes.

A major concern is that most forms of development require draining the peatland. Once drained, the peat dries out, triggering the decomposition of accumulated organic matter and converting these vital carbon sinks into carbon sources. If left unprotected and dry, peatlands will become ecological time bombs.

Additionally, dried peatland surfaces are typically lower in elevation, increasing the risk of severe flooding.

When asked about effective strategies to conserve these unique ecosystems, Melling emphasised the importance of establishing national parks to protect biodiversity and maintain the ecological integrity of Malaysia’s peatland forests.

Malaysia’s peatland forests are not wastelands. They are living, breathing archives of the Earth’s past—and vital to its future. Protecting them is no longer a choice. It is a necessity.",1.74561E+12,en,0.293560803,2025-04-25 04:15:42,"['surface', 'peninsular', 'mitigating', 'serious', 'highly', 'flooding', 'amount', 'provided', 'coloured', 'canopy', 'protecting', 'peatland', 'yet', 'condition', 'unique', 'pool', 'acidic', 'mellings', 'matter', 'tract', 'far', 'greenhouse', 'material', 'remaining', 'world', 'cadaver', 'value', 'urgent', 'longer', 'malaysian', 'dated', 'vast', 'slow', 'living', 'surrounded', 'protect', 'become', 'tropi', 'emphasised', 'teastained', 'used', 'peatlandscovering', 'commitment', 'combined', 'sarawak', 'threat', 'maintain', 'highlight', 'haze', 'differs', 'melling', 'provide', 'archive', 'landscape', 'resilient', 'indigenous', 'known', 'effective', 'development', 'rainforest', 'waterlogged', 'tollund', 'storing', 'million', 'health', 'slowly', 'necessity', 'forested', 'bomb', 'hasselti', 'given', 'tannin', 'research', 'national', 'tree', 'miding', 'belontia', 'according', 'breathing', 'regulator', 'swamp', 'largely', 'converting', 'much', 'land', 'malaysia', 'dark', 'opening', 'treasure', 'even', 'risk', 'cover', 'small', 'rainfall', 'huge', 'time', 'rich', 'lulie', 'gajah', 'generation', 'age', 'nature', 'southeast', 'man', 'soon', 'survive', 'peatlands', 'include', 'wildfire', 'dried', 'becomes', 'severe', 'undermines', 'else', 'source', 'lowland', 'paku', 'within', 'type', 'international', 'specie', 'monkey', 'increasing', 'specialised', 'topohydrological', 'settlement', 'fruit', 'fen', 'vegetation', 'drained', 'trove', 'rise', 'endemic', 'form', 'giant', 'decomposing', 'northwest', 'important', 'make', 'hold', 'sarawakare', 'mengkuang', 'determine', 'meander', 'malay', 'lower', 'gracefully', 'moor', 'water', 'vinegarat', 'region', 'weaving', 'vault', 'biodiversity', 'borneo', 'extraordinary', 'organic', 'oxidises', 'release', 'combtail', 'agricultural', 'mummified', 'disease', 'regulation', 'denmark', 'exist', 'hectare', 'orangutan', 'pastand', 'local', 'still', 'back', 'critically', 'typically', 'quality', 'tropical', 'twice', 'store', 'carbon', 'proboscis', 'particularly', 'choice', 'minnesota', 'treat', 'welcome', 'filter', 'diversity', 'honey', 'ecological', 'tiger', 'rattan', 'crucial', 'gas', 'ago', 'agriculture', 'pose', 'integrity', 'act', 'vital', 'seawater', 'plant', 'change', 'often', 'elusive', 'wetland', 'rhinoceros', 'harbour', 'mitigate', 'park', 'fragile', 'one', 'fish', 'extensive', 'plague', 'expose', 'littered', 'role', 'remarkable', 'characteristic', 'conserve', 'however', 'future', 'play', 'biologically', 'albida', 'ecologically', 'traditional', 'unprotected', 'lifeline', 'preserve', 'need', 'turn', 'additionally', 'ecosystem', 'despite', 'asked', 'climate', 'attention', 'strategy', 'community', 'spell', 'showed', 'home', 'forest', 'sabah', 'herb', 'many', 'seduduk', 'peat', 'fauna', 'new', 'influenced', 'preventing', 'accumulate', 'earth', 'found', 'triggering', 'dictate', 'swampy', 'conservation', 'iron', 'around', 'coastal', 'disturbed', 'regulationabsorbing', 'flammablefuel', 'rare', 'composition', 'dry', 'sink', 'director', 'dipterocarp', 'reservoir', 'year', 'atmosphere', 'entering', 'establishing', 'decomposition', 'accumulated', 'asia', 'congo', 'categorised', 'cultural', 'also', 'area', 'europe', 'layer', 'irreplaceable', 'handicraft', 'call', 'remains', 'fallen', 'wasteland', 'although', 'united', 'major', 'shorea', 'dense', 'fresh', 'institute', 'expanding', 'kingdom', 'thousand', 'releasing', 'natural', 'deep', 'leaf', 'merges', 'released', 'nowhere', 'unexplored', 'draining', 'excess', 'bog', 'sponge', 'ribu', 'lowlying', 'creating', 'elevation', 'overlooked', 'influence', 'movement', 'datu', 'sumatran', 'fact', 'threatens', 'compared', 'concern', 'flora', 'deserves', 'endangered', 'medicinal', 'dome', 'importance', 'require', 'structure', 'said', 'basin', 'left', 'globefrom', 'reflecting', 'like']",Neutral

In a statement, the ministry said the move aims to ensure the quality and sustainability of Malaysia’s rubber glove industry, while preventing the country from becoming a trade diversion hub for foreign-made products.

“This step is taken in view of the global developments that reflect increasing uncertainty in the international trade landscape, including changes in policies among major world markets that directly impact the rubber supply chain and export market,” the ministry said.

It added that such circumstances may trigger an influx of rubber glove imports that could affect the competitiveness of domestic producers.

Malaysia is one of the world’s leading producers and exporters of rubber and rubber-based products, with total exports reaching RM33.7 billion in 2024. Rubber gloves accounted for RM15.41 billion or 45.8% of the total.

In light of global trade challenges, the MRB has introduced strategic initiatives to strengthen regulatory oversight of the industry. These include tightening licensing requirements under the Malaysian Rubber Board (Licensing and Permit) Regulations 2014.

The board is also carrying out joint operations with other enforcement agencies to improve monitoring and enforcement in the rubber glove sector, in an effort to safeguard the industry’s reputation and competitiveness.

The ministry said they and the MRB will continue to monitor international trade developments and stand ready to implement proactive measures to protect Malaysia’s rubber sector.

The ministry also noted that it is exploring suitable strategies to respond to ongoing shifts in global geopolitical and economic conditions, with the goal of maintaining the resilience and global marketability of Malaysian rubber products.

NEW DELHI:

Troops from Pakistan and India exchanged fire overnight across the Line of Control in disputed Kashmir, officials said Friday, after the United Nations urged the nuclear-armed rivals to show “maximum restraint” following a deadly shooting in the region.

Relations have plunged to their lowest level in years, with India accusing Pakistan of supporting “cross-border terrorism” after gunmen carried out the worst attack on civilians in contested Muslim-majority Kashmir for a quarter of a century.

Syed Ashfaq Gilani, a government official in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, told AFP Friday that troops exchanged fire along the Line of Control (LOC) that separates the two countries.

“There was no firing on the civilian population,” he added.

India’s army confirmed there had been limited firing of small arms that it said had been “initiated by Pakistan”, adding it had been “effectively responded to”.

Indian security forces have launched a giant manhunt for those responsible for killing 26 male tourists in Pahalgam on Tuesday—with police naming two Pakistani nationals among the fugitive gunmen.

On Friday Indian troops blew up homes in Kashmir in their search and issued wanted posters with sketches of three men.

Denying any involvement, Islamabad called attempts to link Pakistan to the Pahalgam attack “frivolous” and vowed to respond to any Indian action.

“Any threat to Pakistan’s sovereignty and to the security of its people will be met with firm reciprocal measures in all domains,” a statement said, after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held a rare National Security Committee with top military chiefs.

Pakistan’s Senate on Friday passed a resolution condemning a “campaign by the Indian government to malign the Pakistan government”.

“I say to the whole world: India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backer,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Thursday.

“We will pursue them to the ends of the Earth.”

UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters in New York that issues between the countries “can be and should be resolved peacefully through meaningful mutual engagement”.

“We very much appeal to both the governments... to exercise maximum restraint, and to ensure that the situation and the developments we’ve seen do not deteriorate any further,” he said.

Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since their independence in 1947, with both claiming the territory in full but governing separate portions of it.

Rebel groups have waged an insurgency in Indian-controlled Kashmir since 1989, demanding independence or a merger with Pakistan.

India’s air force and navy both carried out military exercises Thursday.

Indian police say the three gunmen are members of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba group, a UN-designated terrorist organisation.

They offered a two million rupee ($23,500) bounty for information leading to each man’s arrest.

A day after the attack, New Delhi suspended a water-sharing treaty, announced the closure of the main land border crossing with Pakistan, downgraded diplomatic ties, and withdrew visas for Pakistanis.

In response, Islamabad on Thursday ordered the expulsion of Indian diplomats and military advisers, cancelling visas for Indian nationals—with the exception of Sikh pilgrims—and closing the main border crossing from its side.

Pakistan also warned any attempt by India to stop the supply of water from the Indus River would be an “act of war.”

Pahalgam marks a dramatic shift in recent Kashmiri rebel attacks, which typically target Indian security forces.

Experts say that a military response may still be in the pipeline.

In 2019, a suicide attack killed 41 Indian troops in Kashmir and triggered Indian air strikes inside Pakistan, bringing the countries to the brink of all-out war.

“Whatever little land these terrorists have, it’s time to reduce it to dust,” Modi said on Thursday, after holding two minutes of silence in memory of those killed, all but one of whom was Indian.

India has taken its time to respond to past attacks.

The worst attack in recent years in Indian-run Kashmir was at Pulwama in 2019, when insurgents rammed a car packed with explosives into a police convoy, killing 40 and wounding 35.

Indian fighter jets carried out air strikes on Pakistan territory 12 days later.

Tuesday’s assault happened as tourists enjoyed tranquil mountain views at the popular site at Pahalgam, when gunmen burst out of forests and raked crowds with automatic weapons.

Survivors told Indian media the gunmen targeted men and spared those who could give the Islamic declaration of faith.

Indian security forces have launched a vast manhunt for the attackers, with large numbers of people detained.

The attack has enraged Hindu nationalist groups, and students from Kashmir at institutions across India have reported experiencing harassment and intimidation.",1.7457E+12,en,-0.496309191,2025-04-26 08:32:40,"['diplomat', 'minister', 'supporting', 'following', 'cancelling', 'thursday', 'pakistanbased', 'governing', 'side', 'dust', 'pakistanadministered', 'military', 'indian', 'accusing', 'overnight', 'india', 'adviser', 'mutual', 'attack', 'hindu', 'ordered', 'poster', 'suspended', 'world', 'taken', 'held', 'islamabad', 'vast', 'watersharing', 'exchange', 'claiming', 'enjoyed', 'weapon', 'target', 'ashfaq', 'search', 'threat', 'terrorist', 'issue', 'inside', 'stephane', 'shehbaz', 'pakistan', 'syed', 'situation', 'enraged', 'development', 'packed', 'nation', 'resolved', 'domain', 'million', 'rebel', 'raked', 'visa', 'country', 'loc', 'insurgency', 'ensure', 'maximum', 'minute', 'national', 'whatever', 'large', 'male', 'expert', 'site', 'give', 'link', 'air', 'day', 'nationalswith', 'top', 'much', 'memory', 'land', 'prime', 'jet', 'along', 'quarter', 'small', 'pulwama', 'full', 'time', 'identify', 'supply', 'involvement', 'across', 'organisation', 'tuesdaywith', 'track', 'effectively', 'appeal', 'man', 'denying', 'sikh', 'security', 'demanding', 'separate', 'sharif', 'friday', 'pipeline', 'crossborder', 'exercise', 'three', 'number', 'deteriorate', 'river', 'committee', 'show', 'kashmiri', 'explosive', 'contested', 'waged', 'border', 'rise', 'control', 'called', 'giant', 'independence', 'announced', 'senate', 'offered', 'two', 'naming', 'tie', 'detained', 'tension', 'tuesday', 'water', 'region', 'fugitive', 'pakistani', 'little', 'engagement', 'information', 'pahalgam', 'war', 'narendra', 'reported', 'fire', 'population', 'government', 'closure', 'relation', 'spokesman', 'content', 'targeted', 'vowed', 'rival', 'line', 'still', 'nationalist', 'dujarric', 'sketch', 'wanted', 'typically', 'shift', 'seen', 'backer', 'meaningful', 'divided', 'arrest', 'gunman', 'harassment', 'bounty', 'territory', 'tourist', 'crowd', 'say', 'whole', 'exception', 'treaty', 'responded', 'manhunt', 'past', 'condemning', 'silence', 'fighter', 'act', 'firm', 'strike', 'indiancontrolled', 'limited', 'member', 'wounding', 'kashmir', 'gilani', 'declaration', 'advertisement', 'sovereignty', 'responsible', 'men', 'islamic', 'student', 'undesignated', 'bringing', 'afp', 'experiencing', 'end', 'resolution', 'blew', 'launched', 'one', 'killing', 'response', 'suicide', 'survivor', 'force', 'initiated', 'mark', 'warned', 'diplomatic', 'statement', 'among', 'campaign', 'pursue', 'car', 'measure', 'adding', 'nucleararmed', 'delhi', 'action', 'confirmed', 'killed', 'automatic', 'troop', 'every', 'people', 'dramatic', 'assault', 'faith', 'recent', 'brink', 'downgraded', 'intimidation', 'issued', 'spared', 'home', 'forest', 'burst', 'army', 'indianrun', 'police', 'level', 'stop', 'holding', 'muslimmajority', 'new', 'told', 'firing', 'later', 'earth', 'plunged', 'withdrew', 'exchanged', 'passed', 'expulsion', 'rupee', 'shooting', 'pilgrimsand', 'terrorism', 'happened', 'triggered', 'popular', 'lowest', 'respond', 'rare', 'modi', 'civilian', 'year', 'added', 'may', 'portion', 'crossing', 'could', 'tranquil', 'also', 'malign', 'since', 'official', 'united', 'group', 'medium', 'merger', 'view', 'met', 'mountain', 'deadly', 'sponsored', 'insurgent', 'closing', 'peacefully', 'reporter', 'convoy', 'allout', 'leading', 'york', 'disputed', 'rammed', 'lashkaretaiba', 'main', 'would', 'attempt', 'carried', 'institution', 'century', 'frivolous', 'reciprocal', 'reduce', 'restraint', 'worst', 'weve', 'chief', 'gunfire', 'said', 'attacker', 'navy', 'urged', 'arm', 'indus', 'punish']",Neutral
agriculture,Indonesia mulls rare rice exports in bid to boost ties abroad,1.74557E+12,The Edge Malaysia,theedgemalaysia.com,https://news.google.com/read/CBMiUEFVX3lxTE1Da1lKRTFPdWNPOUtYMUFoeTFOcmFRN1hPRDE5VVQ2enlBS3JRdG5BVEhzeGt3YkdwUkIteXd4TVhnUkhIV2Q2VXQ0SVdpNk1t?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/752996,"(April 25): Indonesia is considering exporting rice, a rare phenomenon for a country that often imports itself, in a bid to bolster goodwill with nations in need of the staple grain.

President Prabowo Subianto this week said Indonesia will allow exports of rice to several countries that have approached it for supply. A Japanese delegation also plans to raise the topic in a trip to Jakarta in the coming days, local media has reported, citing Indonesia’s agricultural minister.

The move comes as the country’s production increased this season, boosting stockpiles run by state-owned food logistics company, Bulog. The National Food Agency estimates that Bulog’s reserves may reach four million tons at the end of May, at least double the amount it is usually required to hold to stabilise domestic prices, and it continues to buy from local farmers.

“Previously we have been importing and importing,” Prabowo said during a speech in front of farmers in South Sumatra. “Now we should help other countries.”

Still, Indonesia last exported a substantial amount of rice two decades ago, when it shipped 50,000 tons, and volumes in the years since have totalled 10,000 tons or less. Plus, the nation regularly imports, US Department of Agriculture data show. Purchases last season were the highest since 1997-1998 after dryness fuelled by the El Niño weather phenomenon hurt output.

Prabowo, who took office late last year, has sought to reduce Indonesia’s reliance on food supplies from other countries, especially given heightened global trade tensions and increasingly volatile weather. While Indonesia is already the world’s top palm oil exporter, he also wants it to become a bigger agricultural supplier abroad.

By DayakDaily Team

KUCHING, April 25: Uganda has expressed interest in exploring strategic cooperation with Sarawak in the oil and gas industry and the agricultural sector, with the hope of building a long-term, mutually beneficial bilateral relationship.

The High Commissioner of the Republic of Uganda to Malaysia, Dr Betty Oyella Bigombe, said the East African country is keen to learn from Sarawak’s experience and expertise, particularly in gas separation and oil refinery development, a sector that is currently in the early stages of development in Uganda.

“The oil and gas industry is one of the main focuses, as Uganda is currently in the early stages of developing an oil refinery, and we are aware that Sarawak also has expertise in the gas sector.

“From an agricultural perspective, there is a lot to share with Sarawak. We are involved in coffee cultivation, dairy production, and oil palm. We are also learning from Sarawak, and we hope that this cooperation can continue,” she said in a TVS report.

She said this when met by the media after paying a courtesy call to Sarawak Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg at Wisma Bapa Malaysia today.

According to her, the tourism sector was also discussed in the four-way meeting, which she saw as having great potential to be explored since Sarawak and Uganda have their respective expertise.

Her side was also open to establishing cooperation in other critical sectors, such as trade, which could open up new markets between the two.

Meanwhile, Sarawak Deputy Minister of Energy and Environmental Sustainability, Datuk Dr Hazland Abang Hipni, when met by the media, said that Uganda’s energy landscape, which is dominated by 86 per cent hydroelectricity, resembles Sarawak’s energy structure, making it an ideal platform for cooperation.

“Uganda is exploring the oil and gas sector. This opens up great opportunities for State-linked companies such as Petros to get involved. This strategic potential should be exploited,” he said.

As a step to strengthen bilateral relations, Bigombe also extended an official invitation to Abang Johari and Hazland to pay a working visit to Uganda. — DayakDaily",1.74567E+12,en,0.67657131,2025-04-25 09:45:03,"['uganda', 'stage', 'per', 'deputy', 'minister', 'meeting', 'openg', 'sector', 'early', 'critical', 'side', 'sustainability', 'high', 'particularly', 'involved', 'mutually', 'cooperation', 'perspective', 'cultivation', 'commissioner', 'bigombe', 'continue', 'patinggi', 'extended', 'market', 'gas', 'trade', 'step', 'cent', 'energy', 'courtesy', 'resembles', 'dairy', 'expertise', 'african', 'team', 'oil', 'establishing', 'oyella', 'hope', 'tan', 'could', 'advertisement', 'respective', 'hazland', 'opportunity', 'pay', 'beneficial', 'learning', 'also', 'since', 'republic', 'learn', 'official', 'production', 'call', 'abang', 'experience', 'hipni', 'working', 'separation', 'one', 'refinery', 'potential', 'today', 'medium', 'saw', 'datuk', 'sarawak', 'bapa', 'meanwhile', 'met', 'two', 'open', 'platform', 'kuching', 'visit', 'relationship', 'landscape', 'get', 'ideal', 'development', 'coffee', 'environmental', 'premier', 'building', 'exploring', 'fourway', 'country', 'exploited', 'strengthen', 'explored', 'focus', 'johari', 'invitation', 'agricultural', 'hydroelectricity', 'lot', 'tourism', 'dominated', 'report', 'company', 'main', 'longterm', 'interest', 'according', 'share', 'east', 'betty', 'discussed', 'great', 'tun', 'relation', 'statelinked', 'aware', 'wisma', 'strategic', 'sri', 'april', 'industry', 'palm', 'malaysia', 'structure', 'said', 'bilateral', 'expressed', 'developing', 'currently', 'making', 'dayakdaily', 'paying', 'new', 'petros', 'keen']",Positive

Now, KLCC Connects embodies the Centre’s mission and evolving role as a globally recognised venue that connects people, businesses and ideas - while purposefully fostering collaboration across the business events industry, hospitality sector, tertiary institutions, NGOs, and UNSDG stakeholders such as Urbanice Malaysia.

Through close partnerships with KLCC precinct players and beyond, the Centre advocates collective action on environmental, social and governance (ESG) priorities, working together to shape a more sustainable, inclusive and forward-thinking future.

The campaign is designed to deepen impact, encourage collaboration, and advance sustainable development in line with the Centre’s corporate sustainability priorities. These include reducing Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 25%, setting clear targets and implementing Scope 3 emission reductions across the supply chain, promoting sustainable operations and responsible food sourcing, enhancing community wellbeing, and driving waste reduction.

These efforts align with both Malaysia’s national sustainability commitments and the Centre’s broader mission to foster long-term societal impact through community and educational initiatives. Building on its achievement of reducing food waste by 15% between 2020-2024, the Centre aims to further minimise its environmental footprint while maximising positive social outcomes.

John Burke, General Manager of the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre noted “As a forward-thinking, purpose-driven organisation, the Centre is constantly striving to create meaningful impact in our community and to align with global sustainability goals.

“We believe that sustainability in business is more than just a buzzword – it represents a shift towards responsible, ethical practices that consider long-term value for people, the planet and performance. That’s why we launched KLCC Connects – to bring our partners together on this journey.”

The Centre is rolling out several key initiatives under the KLCC Connects banner throughout 2025:

The Centre will host a symposium on managing exhibition waste. With aims to establish a long-term platform for open dialogue and shared action, the symposium will bring together voices from across the business events ecosystem. By addressing common challenges and encouraging collaboration between organisers, supply chains and venues, the initiative supports the industry’s collective journey towards achieving ESG goals through purposeful and symbiotic partnerships.

Support for the inaugural MyFood Conference in April, developed in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security. This platform will spotlight sustainable agriculture and local sourcing, bringing together stakeholders from across Malaysia’s food ecosystem to strengthen national food security.

Working alongside Urbanice Malaysia, our long-term collaborator, to support the ASEAN Sustainable Urbanisation Forum (ASUF) 2025. This strategic partnership is aimed at amplifying the forum’s outcomes and contributing to the sustainable growth and resilience of Kuala Lumpur, aligning with shared goals for urban transformation and ESG impact.

The third edition of the Centre’s annual Sustainable September campaign returns this year under the theme “One Community, One Future.” This month-long activation will focus on recycling, food sustainability, health, and local empowerment through educational and community-driven initiatives, delivered in collaboration with our KLCC precinct partners. Together, we aim to create meaningful impact through shared action and neighbourhood-wide engagement.

Further cementing its commitment to sustainability, the Centre has partnered with Traders Hotel Kuala Lumpur, Mandarin Oriental Kuala Lumpur, Impiana Hotel KLCC and World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Malaysia to develop a Best Practices Guidebook titled “Waste Management and Sustainable Local Sourcing”. This guidebook will be introduced as supplementary curriculum material in hospitality and culinary institutions, contributing to industry upskilling and sustainable education.

Burke added “As we celebrate our 20th anniversary, we’re looking ahead to the next two decades with a renewed commitment to leading by example within Malaysia’s business events landscape.

“KLCC Connects embodies our vision of a venue that not only facilitates world-class events but actively contributes to building a more sustainable and inclusive future.”

The country's economic engine—once powered by a steady influx of young, able-bodied workers—is beginning to sputter under the weight of an ageing population.



With more employees heading toward retirement and not enough fresh talent stepping in, the pressure is mounting, especially in labour-intensive sectors like agriculture and manufacturing.

Malaysian Employers Federation (MEF) executive director Datuk Shamsuddin Bardan, a labour relations expert, emphasises that Malaysia’s ageing workforce needs to be countered by a shift in the national employment strategy with a focus on inclusivity, technology adoption, and sustainable workforce planning.

The transition, he said, would enable the nation to adapt effectively to the changing demographic landscape, requiring cooperation from the government, employers, and employees alike.

This is because without attention by relevant corporations to address the ageing nation, Malaysia would face economic risks because the overall labour force participation would decline.



""As the older workers retire, they are not being replaced by a proportionate number of younger workers, which could significantly impact productivity across various sectors,"" he said.

""The long-term trend of declining labour force participation due to an ageing population poses a serious risk to economic growth,"" he added.



PRODUCTIVITY AND HEALTHCARE STRAINS ON THE HORIZON

Additionally, he said that the greater burden on the working-age population would strain the healthcare systems and social welfare programmes.

The rapid development of technology would also lead to adaptation challenges among the older workers, making them face difficulties in the workplace, which could hinder innovation and digital transformation in key industries, alongside slowing down productivity at work.

Following these occurrences, Shamsuddin emphasised among the industries most affected, including the manufacturing and construction where the sectors depend heavily on physically demanding labour where the ageing workforce could exacerbate labour shortages. He said that employers should adopt automation and robotics to reduce physical strain and attract younger workers.

Furthermore, he said that the demand for healthcare services would increase with its workforce itself ageing, creating potential shortages. He said that strategies such as mentorship programmes and incentives for experienced healthcare professionals to delay retirement are crucial.

Shamsuddin also said that the ageing nation would impact education where both the teaching workforce and student population face ageing, leading to potential long-term sustainability issues. ""Education reforms and policies to attract younger talent into the profession are necessary,"" he said.





Malaysian Employers' Federation (MEF) executive director, Datuk Shamsuddin Bardan.

Meanwhile, for agriculture, few younger workers are entering the field with the sector facing an ageing workforce. He said that it would be crucial for agritech solutions and supporting agritech start-ups to help modernise the sector in order to make it more attractive to younger generations.

Upon addressing the health and safety concerns among the older workers that affect productivity health, he said that the older workers play a huge part in fluctuating productivity, particularly in physically demanding sectors.

""Older workers experience a decline in physical strength, flexibility, and reaction time, leading to a higher risk of workplace accidents and injuries. In result, there will be increased absenteeism and higher workers' compensation claims,"" the executive director said.

He added that some older workers suffer chronic conditions, such as arthritis and cardiovascular issues, leading to frequent medical leave, further reducing skilled labour availability and increasing healthcare costs for employers, making it vital that they improve their preparedness.



THE IMPORTANCE OF ERGONOMICS AND WORKPLACE DESIGN

In terms of ergonomics, Shamsuddin commented that many workplaces are not designed to accommodate older employees, impacting their efficiency and morale. ""Companies should invest in ergonomic design to enhance the productivity of older workers,"" he urged.

He added that older workers pose potential for redeployment with their valuable institutional knowledge, on the grounds that their health concerns are adequately addressed where the lack thereof would limit their ability to take on the role effectively. Though some of their physical abilities limit their take on strenuous roles, Shamsuddin said that they have the potential for mentorship, quality assurance and training positions which employers should consider to mitigate the loss of productivity.

Furthermore, he said that employers could also mitigate the issues by further investing in an age-friendly workplace design, flexible work arrangements, wellness programmes especially tailored for older workers and knowledge-based roles for them rather than physically demanding tasks.

In maintaining competitiveness despite the ageing workforce, Shamsuddin called on businesses to implement strategies in retaining older workers while fostering innovation, which could be done by intergenerational collaboration which is pairing older employees with younger colleagues.

""This can foster the exchange of experience while gaining fresh perspectives on technology and trends,"" he said.

HARNESSING INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE THROUGH REDEPLOYMENT

Employers could also preserve knowledge by documenting institutional knowledge through digital platforms that could help prevent brain drain as older workers retire. Additionally, he said that employers could offer part-time roles, consultancy positions and flexible work arrangements if they want to retain experienced workers.

Shamsuddin also said that there should be continuous training in digital tools and skills for older workers to ensure that they remain relevant in the increasingly digital-demanding workplace.

For an inclusive environment, he emphasised the importance of an inclusive culture where age bias should be handled effectively with value diverse perspectives in decision-making.

Ergonomic workplaces including suitable physical accommodations, wellness programmes, and mental health support tailored to employees' needs, Shamsuddin said.

Further addressing the importance of creating safer and more inclusive workplaces for older employees, he urged the need for policy shift to improve workplace adaptations with similar practices in the workplace by employers and employees and cultural shifts.

He recommended an application of anti-discrimination policies to prevent age discrimination in hiring, promotions and training opportunities.

The industrial relations expert further emphasised the need for flexible work options to increase productivity where older workers could be offered part-time roles, flexible work arrangements and remote work to accommodate them.

Additionally, he said that it is important to provide regular safety training, including ergonomics and musculoskeletal health in order to ensure that workplaces are designed with older workers considered.



DIGITISING KNOWLEDGE AND OFFERING FLEXIBILITY

He also said that there is a need for the increase of digital literacy among the older workers alongside rapid technological advancements, where training could be provided to assist them in handling digital tools and keeping the workforce competitive.

As a conclusion, he called on the government as the vital role in addressing the challenges posed by an ageing workforce, where flexible retirement should be considered through phased retirement options and tax incentives offer for employers who decide to hire and retain workers.

Shamsuddin also said that the government should offer subsidies for upskilling and reskilling programmes, particularly focusing on digital literacy and new technologies.

Other than that, anti-age discrimination laws and job adaptations for older workers should be implemented, aside from the extension of full Social Security Organisation (Socso) coverage to older workers and providing subsidies for companies that hire workers over 60.

Addressing silver economy where consumers are increasing their purchase amidst the ageing population, he said that it is important to encourage entrepreneurship and second-career programmes for older workers to transition into consultancy or coaching roles.",1.74576E+12,en,-0.469935745,2025-04-27 02:01:54,"['supporting', 'following', 'sector', 'pairing', 'illustrative', 'talent', 'serious',

export,The Significance of the Malaysia-UAE Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA),1.74556E+12,fulcrum.sg,fulcrum.sg,https://news.google.com/read/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOVWdQa0RCQ0E1UTNMSGZxQzI5ajhqMmJ3bGVYSlBlOXhKU2UyRmlSTkY3MkVaQlBvSFZnOFF1YktQNGthUm9TTnRfOXFib05jOUY1eG5vZ0QxSDhiTC13bmotM3JuczFfb0hNNVVaZmNLazNYRTBLa2JfZWUtcWRQcEQtUFB3SnVMYlFrMU5oem9Lbmd0R1ktTUlrUlBIc3NuVXN5eEhHeVlTUQ?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://fulcrum.sg/the-significance-of-the-malaysia-uae-comprehensive-economic-partnership-agreement-cepa/,"The agreement builds on a rapidly strengthening economic relationship, with potential benefits for the UAE’s diversification and Malaysia’s trade and investment.

Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) signed a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) on 14 January 2025, signifying an important shift in Malaysia’s export strategy. The comprehensive agreement is more than a simple trade pact as it encompasses trade in goods and services, investment facilitation, digital trade, support for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and broader economic cooperation. Although the full text of the agreement has not yet been made public as it awaits entry into force, its strategic implications are already evident.

This CEPA is the first cross-border economic agreement signed by Malaysia since its ratification of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) in 2022. It signifies Malaysia’s first tangible step in leveraging economic agreements for effective market diversification, which is one of the country’s core trade strategies as outlined in the 2021 National Trade Blueprint and reaffirmed in the New Industrial Master Plan 2030 (NIMP 2030) launched in 2023. The UAE is Malaysia’s second largest trading partner in the West Asian region.

For the UAE, the CEPA aims to diversify its economy, enhance market access, and expand its international trade networks. Since 2022, the UAE has successfully concluded CEPA agreements with India, Israel, Indonesia, Türkiye, Cambodia, and Georgia, and continues to expand this network. It signed a CEPA with Vietnam in October 2024 and has finalised the scope for negotiations with the Philippines. Talks with Thailand are also underway, with the first round having commenced in May 2023.

The Malaysia-UAE CEPA builds on a rapidly strengthening economic relationship between the two nations. In 2023, bilateral non-oil trade exceeded US$4.9 billion, and trade volumes continued to rise in 2024, with a 7 percent year-on-year increase recorded in the first half alone. The UAE is Malaysia’s 19th export destination, while Malaysia ranks as the UAE’s 15th largest export destination. Key Malaysian exports include jewellery (US$738 million), broadcasting equipment (US$172 million), and other electrical machinery (US$149 million).

In 2024, Malaysia exported US$3.18 billion, while it imported US$6.04 billion from the UAE, leading to a trade deficit for Malaysia. More than 70 per cent of the imports are in crude and refined petroleum. The UAE’s economic diversification from petroleum to manufacturing will expand its demand for non-oil imports such as electrical goods and industrial inputs, as well as services.

The agreement is expected to further enhance Malaysian export potential by lowering UAE’s tariffs from the most-favoured-nation (MFN) average of 4.7 per cent in 2023, and reducing non-tariff barriers, particularly in sectors of strategic importance such as palm oil, halal-certified goods, and Islamic financial services. As in the case of Indonesia, Malaysia sees the UAE not just as a bilateral trade partner, but as a critical gateway to the wider Middle East, North Africa, and European markets.

Malaysia sees the UAE not just as a bilateral trade partner, but as a critical gateway to the wider Middle East, North Africa, and European markets.

A unique and groundbreaking feature of the CEPA is its inclusion of a dedicated chapter on the Islamic economy, which is the first of its kind for Malaysia. This provision is expected to strengthen bilateral cooperation in halal certification, Islamic finance, and digital innovation, including the rapidly growing field of Islamic fintech. The agreement presents new opportunities for collaboration and innovation, given both countries’ common interests in the global halal ecosystem.

Malaysia is also using the CEPA to promote its services, especially in the higher education sector which is focused on attracting more international students. Reportedly, around 700 Emirati students are enrolled in Malaysian institutions in 2021, particularly in postgraduate programs in management, business, finance, and law. The CEPA aspires to facilitate further educational exchanges and cooperation, including in artificial intelligence.

Tourism is another strategic sector targeted for growth under the strengthened bilateral relationship. Malaysia has been actively engaging Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) members, including the UAE, in a bid to boost inbound tourism. In 2019-2023, out of the six GCC countries Malaysia received the most tourists from Saudi Arabia, followed by the UAE.

Importantly, the UAE’s position within the GCC offers Malaysia an indirect entry point into a broader economic bloc. As a member of the GCC, which includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia, the UAE participates in a common market and customs union. This opens up secondary trade opportunities for Malaysian exporters via the UAE’s strong commercial ties with its GCC neighbours. Notably, the region hosts some of the world’s fastest-growing economies; the non-oil sectors of the UAE and Saudi Arabia are projected to grow at 4.8 per cent and 5.8 per cent, respectively, in 2025. Malaysia is currently working to conclude another agreement with the GCC in the near future, to further market diversification, while Prime Minister Anwar has also proposed a CEPA between ASEAN and the GCC.

Despite the agreement’s promising scope, Malaysian businesses, particularly SMEs, may not utilise the CEPA. Historically, Malaysia has had a low utilisation rate of FTAs, as reported in NIMP 2030. This is attributed to compliance costs and limited awareness among smaller firms. For SMEs with lower trade volumes, the administrative burden of meeting rules of origin and certification requirements may outweigh the perceived benefits.

In the case of the Islamic economy, while Malaysia’s halal certification and Islamic finance frameworks are internationally respected and generally recognised in the UAE and broader GCC, each country has its own standards and certification process. Exporters will still need to navigate overlapping regulatory requirements or pursue dual certification to meet local standards. Greater regulatory harmonisation or mutual recognition agreements would go a long way in unlocking the full potential of CEPA in this area.

The Malaysia-UAE CEPA represents a landmark achievement in Malaysia’s evolving trade policy. It not only strengthens bilateral ties with one of the Middle East’s most dynamic economies but also opens doors to wider regional integration across the GCC. The challenge now lies in translating this agreement into tangible economic gains, particularly by ensuring that Malaysian firms, especially the smaller ones, can take full advantage of the opportunities created.

Facebook user Mark Chan shared his experience as a cautionary tale for other diners, posting an image of his modest meal consisting of a small portion of vegetables, approximately seven slices of roast pork, and cucumber garnish, accompanied by herbal tea.

Chan provided proof of payment via a Touch ‘n Go eWallet screenshot, clarifying in comment responses that the economy rice itself cost RM25 while the beverage added another RM3.

He warned fellow consumers about what he termed a “black stall” (??), a colloquial expression for businesses engaging in questionable practices.

When questioned by commenters whether he might have misheard the price, possibly confusing RM18 for RM28, Chan insisted he had confirmed the cost three times with the vendor.

Several netizens noted that even RM18 would be considered excessive for such a basic meal.

The post sparked humorous comments from social media users who joked that the pork must have been premium Iberian pork imported from Spain, suggesting the animals received luxury treatment comparable to Japanese wagyu beef, including “air-conditioning, music and abalone.”

Several netizens advised Chan to report the incident to consumer protection authorities, noting that his digital payment record and photographic evidence would support such a complaint.",1.74576E+12,en,-0.403411657,2025-04-27 03:56:00,"['time', 'online', 'china', 'excessive', 'including', 'netizens', 'segambut', 'provided', 'evidence', 'meal', 'screenshot', 'vendor', 'cheras', 'photographic', 'posting', 'social', 'misheard', 'charged', 'another', 'music', 'herbal', 'chan', 'shared', 'lumpurs', 'questioned', 'must', 'added', 'portion', 'tea', 'humorous', 'malaysian', 'three', 'park', 'ewallet', 'complaint', 'iberian', 'comment', 'rice', 'also', 'suggesting', 'area', 'considered', 'facebook', 'slice', 'experience', 'protection', 'business', 'medium', 'response', 'incident', 'joked', 'basic', 'engaging', 'airconditioning', 'might', 'wagyu', 'cai', 'customer', 'animal', 'roast', 'advised', 'colloquial', 'described', 'mark', 'beverage', 'confusing', 'warned', 'premium', 'abalone', 'payment', 'record', 'expression', 'support', 'noted', 'read', 'proof', 'comparable', 'cucumber', 'modest', 'cost', 'luxury', 'cautionary', 'authority', 'price', 'vegetable', 'clarifying', 'eatery', 'confirmed', 'termed', 'expensive', 'insisted', 'digital', 'stall', 'approximately', 'png', 'report', 'black', 'via', 'spain', 'accompanied', 'would', 'imported', 'garnish', 'possibly', 'pork', 'according', 'noting', 'diner', 'received', 'questionable', 'kuala', 'consisting', 'industrial', 'economy', 'practice', 'japanese', 'beef', 'fellow', 'outrage', 'surprisingly', 'user', 'whether', 'seven', 'touch', 'treatment', 'several', 'reportedly', 'post', 'expressed', 'image', 'even', 'sparked', 'paying', 'tale', 'consumer', 'small', 'commenters', 'press']",Neutral

A high powered delegation led by the Finance Minister Hon. Matia Kasaija, comprises Energy Minister Hon. Ruth Nankabirwa, Agriculture Minister in charge of Animal Husbandry, Hon Bright Rwamirama, Uganda’s High Commissioner to Malaysia, Amb Betty O. Bigombe, Chamber of Commerce- President Olive Kigongo, Senior Presidential Adviser on Exports-Mrs. Susan Muhwezi and Chief of Protocol, Amb Charles Ssentongo, The opening ceremony was graced by Hon. Yang Bhg Muhtar Hashim, the Executive Director of the Chemical Industries Council of Malasyia. Muhtar informed the audience of the immense opportunities that Malaysia will tap into the various to drive trade between the two countries.

Speaking at the same Ceremony, Hon. Matia Kasaija said Uganda has a conducive climate investment that supports the most important needs of investors across board, including the legal framework.



Ruth Nankabirwa, the Energy Minister said Uganda continues to attract investment in the oil and gas sector. “Our policy is not to export any raw materials, so there is plenty of investment opportunities in mineral processing” adding that Uganda has a number of minerals and areas of investment. “Our iron ore is the best in the world, we have copper, oil, gold, several other minerals and are looking for investors in the sector,” Nankabirwa added. Ambassador Betty Bigombe said the Trade and Investment Forum reflected our mutual commitment to deepening economic, trade, and investment ties between Uganda and Malaysia. “Today is more than just a business forum; it is a bridge between nations, between opportunity and ambition, and between vision and action.”

Bigombe gave rousing remarks about Uganda, which she said was blessed with vast natural resources, a youthful and energetic population, and a stable and liberalized economy. “Uganda is strategically positioned as a gateway to the East African Community (EAC), a vibrant market of over 300 million consumers, and to the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA). Investors who choose Uganda will not just invest in one country; rather, they will access an entire regional market full of opportunity and potential.” This Expo is themed “Unlocking Uganda’s Business Potential,” with a focus on five high-impact sectors that are central to our national development strategy: agro-industrialisation, tourism development, oil and gas, science and technology, and mineral development.

In agro-industrialisation, Bigombe said Uganda’s fertile land and diverse agricultural outputs provide immense opportunities for value addition, agro-processing, and export-driven agribusiness. In tourism, she invited investment in eco-lodges, hospitality services, and tourism infrastructure to harness the potential of Ugandan national parks, including Kidepo Valley, Queen Elizabeth,

Murchison Falls, and the breath-taking Rwenzori Mountains. In the oil and gas sector, Uganda has made great strides, and several bankable projects are ready for investors. These include the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP), the development of an oil refinery in Hoima, and the construction of logistics hubs to support the petroleum value chain.

In science and technology, Uganda is driving digital transformation and innovation through ICT parks, youth innovation hubs, and the local assembly of tech devices. In mineral development, Uganda is richly endowed with gold, cobalt, rare earth elements, and more, and we welcome investors for sustainable and value-added exploitation. Amb. Bigombe highlighted Uganda Investment Authority’s role in establishing a one-stop center to facilitate investors with licenses, land, tax advisory, and regulatory support.

Uganda permits 100% foreign ownership in most sectors, guarantees repatriation of profits, and offers tax holidays, customs exemptions, and infrastructure support for priority areas.

Furthermore, the UIA has also profiled over 120 bankable investment projects, spanning road infrastructure, tourism sites, agribusiness parks, and industrial parks across the country. The two-day forum has attracted a number of private investors from Uganda and Malaysia.

KUALA LUMPUR, April 26 (Bernama) -- The heat of the clash between Johor Darul Ta'zim (JDT) and Sri Pahang FC in the 2024/2025 Malaysia Cup final has begun to be felt with a sea of ??'red and blue' as well as 'yellow blue' flooding the grounds of the Bukit Jalil National Stadium (SNBJ) here since 4 pm today. The weather at the home venue of the national football team was slightly cloudy following a light rain early this evening, but this did not dampen the spirits of the supporters who were present ahead of the match kick-off scheduled for 9 pm. The atmosphere was lively with various activities attracting the attention of supporters of both teams, which was also further heated up by Amy Search's First Solo Concert held at the Axiata Arena next to the stadium on the same day.

Confidence in the ability of his proud team prompted one of Sri Pahang's loyal supporters, Syamsuri Saari, to travel from Jerantut to SNBJ with his three children, namely Mohd Shaufiqul Islam, 13, Mohd Uwais Al Qarni, 12, Ariq Arrayyan, 11. ""We are here because it has been eleven years since we last went to the final, so even though we know we may lose, the hope of winning is still there, because in football, someone has to lose but winning is not known yet for both JDT and Sri Pahang. ""I have been a Pahang fan since the beginning and often go to the stadium no matter what the match is, and in the last four years I started bringing my children to the stadium with me and this tradition continues,"" said the 47-year-old government employee.

Meanwhile, non-governmental organisation Johor Volunteers brought more than 2,000 JDT supporters to brightened the atmosphere with cheers and displaying banners. The coordinator, Tun Naim Satiman said that as soon as the final date was announced, they planned to gather a group to boost the spirits of the Johoreans in the final match. “When the club successfully booked a place for the final match and the date was confirmed, we immediately planned to support the team, as well as be another strength with the Boys of Straits (loyal JDT supporters),” he said.",1.74578E+12,en,0.49060756,2025-04-26 13:26:31,"['four', 'volunteer', 'following', 'cloudy', 'bukit', 'brought', 'felt', 'strait', 'early', 'organisation', 'flooding', 'darul', 'cheer', 'sea', 'light', 'soon', 'qarni', 'present', 'yet', 'successfully', 'blue', 'displaying', 'namely', 'jerantut', 'mohd', 'saari', 'someone', 'matter', 'another', 'concert', 'travel', 'lumpur', 'winning', 'last', 'tradition', 'clash', 'team', 'year', 'atmosphere', 'cup', 'stadium', 'often', 'boost', 'lose', 'planned', 'may', 'hope', 'held', 'employee', 'coordinator', 'weather', 'football', 'spirit', 'three', 'though', 'also', 'since', 'venue', 'axiata', 'went', 'continues', 'islam', 'arena', 'final', 'bringing', 'prompted', 'attracting', 'tazim', 'one', 'uwais', 'banner', 'today', 'eleven', 'group', 'know', 'place', 'meanwhile', 'booked', 'search', 'kickoff', 'jalil', 'announced', 'strength', 'begun', 'well', 'yearold', 'proud', 'date', 'satiman', 'known', 'confidence', 'evening', 'support', 'amy', 'ariq', 'bernama', 'boy', 'first', 'supporter', 'snbj', 'ability', 'confirmed', 'activity', 'solo', 'nongovernmental', 'arrayyan', 'attention', 'club', 'national', 'ahead', 'ground', 'naim', 'fan', 'slightly', 'rain', 'started', 'heated', 'kuala', 'government', 'dampen', 'scheduled', 'tun', 'red', 'syamsuri', 'gather', 'johoreans', 'day', 'child', 'immediately', 'home', 'next', 'sri', 'pahangs', 'still', 'jdt', 'april', 'heat', 'match', 'various', 'malaysia', 'said', 'shaufiqul', 'beginning', 'even', 'johor', 'lively', 'brightened', 'yellow', 'pahang', 'loyal']",Neutral

One thing that makes the game stand out is that every jewelry piece in the game is designed by Javier León, an Emmy-nominated digital artist. You can show off your collection in The Gallery, a social space. Plus, the next-gen visuals, especially how the diamonds use ray-tracing, really draw me in.

Even though the game uses blockchain technology and offers a Web3 marketplace, it’s optional, which I appreciate. Overall, it looks full of potential, from its stunning jewelry pieces, social Gallery, to next-level visuals with ray-tracing, innovative puzzle mechanics, focus on craftsmanship, and more.

Diamond Dreams is set to soft launch on mobile in Malaysia this weekend. Stay tuned in this space for future updates!

Martin proposed that UKM engage with the Sarawak government and collaborate with Yayasan Sarawak to realise the plan.

“UKM is one of the top universities in Malaysia, and Serian would be an ideal location should this plan come to fruition,” he said at the launch of MPOB-UKM@Kampung programme, held at the Serian Convention Centre yesterday.

Responding to remarks by UKM’s Pro Vice-Chancellor for Strategy and Corporate Development Professor Datuk Dr Roslee Rajikan, Martin said the proposed campus would support UKM’s commitment to expanding its national footprint.

Roslee, who spoke earlier, noted UKM’s improved standing in the QS World University Rankings 2025, rising from 159th to 138th globally.

Martin, who is also the Kedup assemblyman, expressed appreciation to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) and Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) for initiatives aimed at uplifting smallholders’ income in the region.

“There are currently over 2,200 smallholders in Serian cultivating 12,000 hectares of palm oil,” he said, citing data sourced from MPOB deputy director-general (Research and Development) Dr Ramle Moslim.

He emphasised that agriculture must be seen as a strategic business venture rather than a fallback for those less academically inclined, citing that palm oil contributes 68 per cent to Sarawak’s agricultural gross domestic product (GDP).

“Don’t look at agriculture as only for those who fail in school but look at it as a business venture – as a way to improve life,” he said, while praising and acknowledging the smallholders’ efforts to develop their native lands and increase family incomes.

Moreover, he said the Ministry of Food Industry, Commodity and Regional Development (M-Ficord) had set a target for smallholders to achieve earnings of up to RM6,000 monthly through modern farming and crop diversification.

The one-day programme, attended by some 350 participants, was a collaborative initiative between MPOB-UKM Endowment Chair and the Serian smallholders.

Road accidents up in Malaysia’s Hari Raya rush in 2025, totalling over 15,000

- More than 15,000 road accidents and 123 deaths were recorded in Malaysia during the Hari Raya travel period in April, according to statistics from Bukit Aman’s Traffic Investigation and Enforcement Department.

This marked a 3.8 per cent increase in the total number of road accidents between March 29 and April 6 (15,246) compared with the Hari Raya travel period between April 6 and April 14 in 2024 (14,674).

As for the number of deaths related to road accidents, the data showed a 29.3 per cent decline.

A total of 123 people died in road accidents between March 29 and April 6 in 2025 compared with 174 during the travel period in 2024.

For the travel period in 2025, March 29 recorded the highest number of road accidents at 2,040, while the highest number of fatalities was on March 30 (20).

The highest number of road accidents during Hari Raya celebrations in 2024 was on April 6 (2,156), while the highest number of deaths was on April 10 (35).

Hari Raya celebrations fell on March 31 in 2025 and April 10 in 2024.

Statistics showed a similar trend in which the 2024 operations, which lasted between April 8 to April 13, recorded 8,909 accidents and 111 fatalities.

For 2025, a total of 9,859 road accidents and 85 fatalities were recorded between March 29 and April 3. This marked a 10.66 per cent increase in the number of accidents and a 23.42 per cent decline in related fatalities.

Road safety expert Law Teik Hua said the drop in road fatalities suggests that emergency response times, vehicle safety standard and possibly even driving behaviour had improved.

“However, the fact that overall accidents increased, albeit slightly, reminds us that the underlying risk on our roads remains high.

“Every crash, regardless of severity, carries emotional, physical and financial consequences.

“The volume of incidents still points to systemic road safety challenges,” said Associate Professor Law, who heads the Road Safety Research Centre at the Engineering Faculty of Universiti Putra Malaysia.

He said there should be efforts such as strengthening enforcement during peak travel periods, enhancing driver education about fatigue and behaviours like speeding, and ensuring public transport alternatives are safe and accessible.

“Infrastructure improvements like clear road signage, better lighting and speed-calming measures can also help mitigate crash likelihood,” said Prof Law.

He said real-time traffic data, smart traffic management systems and dashcam artificial intelligence analytics could help identify accident-prone zones and driver behaviour.

“Public campaigns should evolve from awareness to behavior change, leveraging psychology and targeted communication to truly influence drivers,” he said.

Malaysian Institute of Road Safety Research chairman Wong Shaw Voon urged motorists to drive safely at all times.

“We shouldn’t practise safe behaviour only when we know enforcement officers are watching.

“This is about our own lives, and also that of our loved ones who are with us in the vehicle,” said Professor Wong.

“Enforcement authorities are doing their best to make the roads a safer place, but every road user plays a role towards achieving this as well,” he added. THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK

SABAH is blessed with rich biodiversity, fertile land, and high annual rainfall – conditions ideal for agriculture. Yet, like many regions balancing development with environmental and logistical challenges, Sabah remains partially reliant on imported food supplies.

Currently, over 60pc of its food – particularly rice, vegetables, and meat products – is sourced externally, leaving it exposed to supply chain disruptions and global price volatility.

However, this also presents an opportunity. By leveraging engineering innovation, systems thinking, and cross-sector collaboration, Sabah can build a resilient, sustainable, and inclusive food ecosystem.

Let us explore how engineering can support and enhance state initiatives, address structural challenges, and pave the way for food self-sufficiency.

Sabah’s food sector faces a combination of environmental, technical, and infrastructural constraints:

Advertisement

– Sabah currently produces about 23pc of its rice needs and relies heavily on imported meat and vegetables.

– Estimates suggest up to 40pc of perishable crops are lost due to inadequate storage and logistics.

Advertisement

– Floods, droughts, and soil degradation increasingly affect yield stability.

– Mountainous terrain and remote rural settlements complicate farm-to-market connectivity.

– Many farmers still use rain-fed irrigation and manual tools, limiting productivity.

These realities, long acknowledged by policymakers and development agencies, underscore the need for multidisciplinary engineering contributions to complement agricultural policy.

– Sabah’s hilly geography makes road construction both critical and complex. Engineering solutions such as geosynthetics, modular bridge systems, and slope stabilization techniques can improve year-round connectivity. These technologies are particularly useful in areas like Pitas, Tenom, and Nabawan, where improved roads can reduce crop spoilage and improve market access.

– Building upon current irrigation programs, engineers can design efficient water delivery systems – including drip irrigation, gravity-fed canals, and solar pump systems – suited to Sabah’s microclimates. Surface drainage systems and flood-retention ponds can protect low-lying paddy fields, particularly in areas like Kota Belud. Integrated water resource management is key to resilience.

– Solar-powered cold storage units using phase change materials (PCMs), along with decentralized processing hubs, can help reduce post-harvest losses in perishable products. Mechanical and process engineers can work with local cooperatives to install modular rice mills, cassava dryers, and fish processing units – boosting rural incomes and value addition.

IoT Soil Sensors to monitor moisture, temperature, and nutrients.

Drone Surveillance with multispectral imaging to detect crop stress and pests.

GIS Mapping for precision application of water and fertilizer.

Such approaches improve yields while reducing environmental impacts – initiatives already piloted in districts like Ranau and Kundasang.

Solar PV Systems for irrigation and refrigeration.

Biogas Units converting animal waste into energy and organic fertilizers.

Micro-Hydro Systems using highland streams for electricity generation.

Engineering expertise is needed to design hybrid systems with appropriate load management, battery storage, and safety measures.

Flood-Control Infrastructure (e.g., culverts, bunds, retention ponds) can safeguard farmland.

Salt-Tolerant Greenhouses and elevated aquaponics systems protect against sea-level rise and waterlogging.

Slope-Stabilized Planting Terraces help retain soil in erosion-prone zones.

Designing such systems requires close integration of hydrology, structural engineering, and local environmental data.

4.1 Blockchain and Traceability – Blockchain systems, combined with QR-coded packaging, can trace food origins, support Halal and organic certifications, and ensure quality. This benefits both farmers and consumers. Such platforms should be mobile-friendly and available in local languages to improve adoption.

– Blockchain systems, combined with QR-coded packaging, can trace food origins, support Halal and organic certifications, and ensure quality. This benefits both farmers and consumers. Such platforms should be mobile-friendly and available in local languages to improve adoption. 4.2 AI-Based Smart Logistics – Flood-prone and rural zones can benefit from AI-driven logistics systems that use weather data, road conditions, and real-time transport tracking. During the 2021 floods, similar systems rerouted critical supplies successfully. Developing such tools in collaboration with disaster agencies and farmer cooperatives enhances preparedness and resilience.

Financing and Investment: Engineering projects are capital-intensive. Public-private partnerships (PPPs), development funds, and Asean or UN-backed grants can help scale up pilots.

Skills and Talent Development: Institutions like Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS) and local polytechnics can expand agri-tech and agri-engineering courses, blending agriculture with data science, energy, and design.

Community-Centric Design: Technology must fit local needs. Engineers should conduct participatory rural appraisals and engage local communities to co-design solutions.

Engineering-based transformation requires an enabling environment. Key challenges include:

Integrating Engineering into RMK Plans: Prioritize agriculture-linked infrastructure and technology in Sabah’s development roadmaps. Incentivizing Green and Smart Farming: Offer fiscal incentives (e.g., tax breaks, green loans) for businesses deploying renewable energy or agri-tech systems. Forming Multisectoral Task Forces: Link engineers, farmers, NGOs, academics, and civil service units in coordinated project teams for infrastructure planning and monitoring.

To support food system modernization in alignment with Sabah’s development goals, policymakers may consider:

Engineering is not just about infrastructure – it is a bridge between technology, sustainability, and livelihoods. In Sabah, engineering can reinforce the State Government’s goals by reducing food import dependency, enhancing rural resilience, and building a future-ready agricultural sector.

Kota Kinabalu:

Sabah is set to host Malaysia’s first integrated solar-poultry farm, following the signing of a landmark Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Koperasi Star Sabah Berhad and High Power New Energy Sdn Bhd.

The RM800 million project, located on 500 acres in Nabawan, will combine a large-scale poultry operation with a 150MW solar power plant supported by battery energy storage (BESS).

The hybrid model aims to simultaneously address Sabah’s electricity needs and boost local food production.

Officiating the signing on Thursday, Deputy Chief Minister I and Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Industry (MAFFI) Datuk Seri Dr. Jeffrey Kitingan called the initiative a model for sustainable rural development.

“This project is about more than just renewable energy. It’s about shaping the future of our communities by creating jobs, strengthening food security, and powering areas like Nabawan, Tambunan, and the soon-to-be-upgraded full district of Sook,” said Dr. Jeffrey.

The solar plant, expected to be operational within two years, will supply much-needed electricity to interior regions of Sabah, where shortages remain a pressing issue.

The stable power supply is anticipated to draw further investment into rural areas and support broader economic activity.

At the same time, the poultry farm would help to meet Sabah’s domestic demand of 1 million chickens per day so dependency on chicken imports from the peninsula and abroad can be reduced.

The farm will also incorporate feed production, involving local communities in upstream agriculture.

Dr. Jeffrey emphasized that this pioneering dual-sector initiative is in line with the Sabah government’s mission to uplift rural communities through inclusive economic models.

“Every family, every farmer, and every member of the rural community deserves equal opportunity to progress and compete,” he said.

The project is expected to create hundreds of jobs during both the construction and operational phases, ranging from technical roles in solar energy maintenance to poultry management and logistics.

It will also spur development of essential infrastructure including housing, transport, and education.

“Additionally, High Power New Energy will contribute 10 percent of net profits to a trust fund managed by the Sabah Veterinary Department to support infrastructure development and community programs without relying solely on state or federal budgets.

“As part of the initiative, Koperasi Star Sabah plans to establish an education fund in the interior regions to invest in youth development and human capital.

Dr. Jeffrey concluded by urging all stakeholders including the veterinary department, community organizations, and local residents to work hand in hand to ensure the project’s success.

“This is not just a pilot, this is a new model for Sabah’s development. Let us make it a success story for the whole state,”he said.",1.74567E+12,en,0.42286247,2025-04-26 00:37:30,"['per', 'full', 'bess', 'deputy', 'minister', 'following', 'officiating', 'time', 'supported', 'family', 'thursday', 'net', 'supply', 'fishery', 'work', 'pressing', 'high', 'including', 'resident', 'integrated', 'berhad', 'import', 'story', 'whole', 'program', 'pilot', 'inclusive', 'sdn', 'signing', 'dualsector', 'security', 'seri', 'simultaneously', 'statehe', 'trust', 'agriculture', 'expected', 'soontobeupgraded', 'energy', 'landmark', 'budget', 'solely', 'plan', 'hybrid', 'investment', 'largescale', 'logistics', 'domestic', 'food', 'invest', 'plant', 'mission', 'year', 'farm', 'infrastructure', 'boost', 'within', 'dependency', 'compete', 'relying', 'concluded', 'essential', 'member', 'powering', 'strengthening', 'construction', 'advertisement', 'located', 'kota', 'incorporate', 'power', 'opportunity', 'progress', 'organization', 'economic', 'also', 'area', 'kinabalu', 'upstream', 'management', 'contribute', 'address', 'housing', 'production', 'hand', 'stable', 'kitingan', 'stakeholder', 'sook', 'renewable', 'host', 'state', 'solarpoultry', 'model', 'datuk', 'set', 'called', 'spur', 'issue', 'make', 'two', 'farmer', 'sponsored', 'role', 'feed', 'without', 'memorandum', 'youth', 'reduced', 'fund', 'future', 'profit', 'district', 'chicken', 'veterinary', 'emphasized', 'federal', 'draw', 'battery', 'support', 'ranging', 'development', 'maffi', 'education', 'region', 'demand', 'pioneering', 'anticipated', 'job', 'million', 'bhd', 'star', 'capital', 'first', 'need', 'operational', 'transport', 'interior', 'abroad', 'poultry', 'create', 'nabawan', 'shaping', 'acre', 'koperasi', 'creating', 'peninsula', 'technical', 'ensure', 'activity', 'maintenance', 'every', 'understanding', 'additionally', 'success', 'phase', 'electricity', 'involving', 'urging', 'help', 'community', 'would', 'remain', 'human', 'meet', 'combine', 'let', 'aim', 'part', 'government', 'muchneeded', 'broader', 'shortage', 'deserves', 'content', 'equal', 'day', 'managed', 'operation', 'uplift', 'percent', 'local', 'jeffrey', 'sabah', 'initiative', 'line', 'chief', 'mou', 'storage', 'rural', 'industry', 'establish', 'department', 'malaysia', 'said', 'project', 'sustainable', 'new', 'solar', 'hundred', 'tambunan', 'like']",Neutral

According to Sinar Harian, Deputy President of the JDT Football Supporters Club (KPBJDT), Mohd Fadzli Sapie, said the figure was based on sources informing him that ticket sales were approaching that number.

“Supporters departing from the Tan Sri Datuk Haji Hassan Yunos Stadium will fill 15 buses, while the rest will be travelling from their respective districts,” he was quoted as saying.

“This season, KPBJDT has joined forces with other fan clubs including the Boys of Straits (BOS), who have arranged nearly 100 buses. We’ll be meeting with other buses coming from Segamat, Pontian, Kulai, and Ayer Hitam.

“Although ticket sales have been somewhat sluggish this time around, the turnout of fans wanting to watch the Malaysia Cup final at the Bukit Jalil National Stadium has been beyond expectations,” he told Sinar Harian when met earlier at the Tan Sri Haji Hassan Yunos Stadium.

Throughout April, families are still visiting relatives, hosting open houses, and keeping the festive spirit alive - activities that fuel the oft-repeated joke that Hari Raya in Malaysia lasts a whole entire month.

And what’s a Raya celebration without kuih raya?

The importance of kuih raya among Malaysians is evident, as search interest for it spikes right before Hari Raya. In the week before the festivities this year (March 23 to 29), searches for the term ""Kuih Raya” increased exponentially compared to other weeks.

A similar trend was seen in the week before Hari Raya celebrations in 2023 and 2024.

These days, however, the traditional kuih raya seem to take on interesting modern twists. The beloved cornflakes madu cups now come in multiple variations including a salted caramel version, while ""sea salt chocolate chip cookies” and ""cappuccino cream cookies” are now in high demand, despite their premium price tag.

Using Google Trends data from January 1 to March 31, 2025, Garasi Bernama examined eight traditional Malaysian kuih raya - Almond London, Batang Buruk, Biskut Makmur, Biskut Cornflakes, Kuih Semperit, Kuih Bangkit, Mama Carey, and Tart Nanas - to explore what remains popular, which are fading, and how social media influences the tastes of a new generation.

The One Malaysians Are Googling the Most

Google Trends data from January to March 2025 reveal that ""Biskut Cornflakes” was the most searched traditional kuih raya. ""Kuih Semperit” (interestingly spelled as ""Kue Semprit”) and ""Tart Nanas” followed as the second and third most searched traditional kuih raya, respectively.

""Kuih semperit and tart nanas are among my favourite kuih raya,” shares Fatiha Ramdzan, 35. ""Traditional kuih raya are still a must-have for me. The trendier versions are usually gifted to me or baked by my mother-in-law.”

Other traditional kuih raya such as ""Kuih Bangkit”, ""Mama Carey” and ""Biskut Makmur” were the least popular options this year, generating the lowest amount of search interest.

Fatiha has also noticed that biskut makmur is becoming less commonly served during Aidilfitri these days.

""I don’t see it as much anymore, it seems to be fading out,” she says.

A closer look at each kuih raya’s search interest showed that March was the peak month for searches - unsurprising, as it coincided with the fasting month and the lead-up to Hari Raya Aidilfitri. Most people begin looking for kuih raya during this period, as buying or baking them too early means they may not stay fresh for the celebrations.

Out of all eight traditional kuih raya, ""Biskut Cornflakes” showed the most consistent search interest, with interest steadily building from the beginning of January (January 1, 2025) until the end of March (March 31, 2025). Interest in it peaked on March 29, 2025 with a search interest value of 100.

(The figures reflect popularity, not the number of searches. Google uses a value of 100 to reflect the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular.)

Kuih raya that are simple and practical to make are among the key factors influencing trends each year, says Dr Muhammad Rezza Zainal Abidin, Senior Lecturer at Universiti Putra Malaysia’s Department of Food Service and Management.

""Practicality is a major consideration. With many Malaysians leading busy lifestyles, simple, no-bake or easy-to-make kuih raya recipes are becoming more desirable,” he told Bernama.

Other factors such as shifting consumer preferences, the power of social media, international influence and aesthetic appeal also play significant roles in shaping kuih raya trends, says Rezza, who co-authored the paper Modern Malaysian Cuisine: Identity, Culture, or Modern-day Fad.

Simple and practical is a description that fits ""Biskut Cornflakes” perfectly. It’s quick to prepare, a favourite among children, and requires minimal ingredients such as butter, honey, and cornflakes. This simplicity, combined with nostalgic value and accessibility, may explain why it emerged as the most searched traditional kuih raya in 2025.

Its popularity also reflects a broader shift in how Malaysians approach festive baking - opting for recipes that are convenient yet still festive and flavourful. In a season filled with open houses and busy schedules, the appeal of a fast, familiar, and fuss-free treat resonates strongly.

Rising Costs, Changing Tastes

Another key factor shaping traditional kuih raya trends in 2025 is affordability. Rising ingredient costs are influencing what Malaysians choose to bake or buy.

For the founder of Brown Butter Bakes, Nurulhuda Qamaruz Zaman, rising ingredient costs have required careful adjustments to maintain quality and keep her business sustainable.

""It's inevitable. Our number one bestseller - the Korova Sable cookies - uses premium imported chocolate, which has doubled in price since 2022. Prices of other ingredients like butter and nuts have also increased significantly,” she said.

""We’ve had no choice but to raise our prices to maintain the quality our customers expect and keep the business viable,” added Nurulhuda, who has been selling Hari Raya cookies commercially since November 2017.

This economic shift may help explain why the lower-cost kuih raya made from cornflakes are trending higher than options made with nuts and imported chocolate, which require more time, effort, and cost.

The Favourites State-by-State

Across different states, regional tastes continue to shape which traditional kuih raya rises to the top.

In Kelantan, both ""Almond London” and ""Mama Carey” topped search interest, pointing to a preference for richer, buttery cookies. In Sabah, the traditional ""Batang Buruk” proved most popular, while ""Biskut Makmur” led in Kedah, showing the continued appeal of crumbly, nutty textures.

Meanwhile, Terengganu leaned toward convenience with ""Biskut Cornflakes” leading the search charts. Up north in Perlis, the buttery simplicity of ""Kuih Semperit” was most favoured. Finally, in Malacca, ""Kuih Bangkit” and ""Tart Nenas"" emerged as the top favourites.

Traditional Kuih Raya at Risk of Disappearing?

With evolving tastes and the rise of fusion kuih raya, some may wonder if traditional favourites are slowly fading.

For Rezza, that’s far from the case.

""Traditional kuih raya recipes face challenges, but I wouldn’t say they are at risk of disappearing. Instead, they are evolving,” he said

He adds that modern adaptations can even help preserve these kuih raya by making them more appealing to younger generations - so long as the original flavours and essence are not lost along the way.

This view is reflected in Google’s search trends. Breakout search queries related to the eight kuih raya analysed by Bernama showed results like ""Salted Caramel Cornflakes”, ""Semperit Cheese”, ""Bangkit Cheese” and ""Tart Cadbury”.

This suggests that Malaysians are not just searching for the classics, but also exploring modern twists and bolder flavour profiles. These trends could reflect not only evolving taste buds but also a deeper curiosity about how tradition can be reinvented.

Yet, demand for the classics remains strong. Although her kuih raya lineup focuses primarily on modern flavours, Nurulhuda continues to offer one traditional favourite - the kuih semperit.

""The classic semperit has a good fan base. It appeals to both young and old and is a great symbol of Raya, much like the ketupat.

""Selling it turned out to be such a good decision, as we discovered that many find our semperit to be as good and authentic as what their elders used to lovingly make for their families,” she said.

The Role of Social Media & Influencers

The digital world is now a key ingredient in festive food trends.

Breakout search queries like ""Almond London Che Nom”, ""Resepi Biskut Makmur Che Nom” and ""Cornflakes Madu Che Nom” show just how influential Malaysia’s homegrown food influencers have become.

""Social media influencers like Khairul Aming and Che Nom are more than just content creators - they're trendsetters.

""When they share a kuih raya recipe, it’s not just a recipe. It’s an experience that thousands want to recreate in their own kitchens,” said Rezza.

For Nur Aina Alimin, 31, these influencers shape not only what she cooks, but what she craves.

""Totally. Any food recipe to be honest,” she said, when asked if she had ever tried a kuih raya recipe because of something she saw on social media. ""I will save it in my Instagram saved folder which may or may not be used in the future.”

She adds that certain influencers do influence her choices - particularly when they’re seen as reliable.

""I follow them because they’re consistent in sharing tried and true recipes,” she said. ""It’s also helpful that their content often comes in video form.”

And she’s not just watching - she’s experimenting too. ""I tried making the viral caramel cornflakes this year with a spin of my own. I added almonds and another is a seeded version,” she said.

While influencers help revive interest in traditional recipes through step-by-step tutorials and storytelling, Muhammad Rezza notes that the attention isn’t always evenly distributed.

""On one hand, influencers help preserve traditional kuih raya by modernising them. Think kuih semperit with matcha flavour or kuih kapit with biscoff filling. These creative variations attract younger consumers and ensure that kuih raya remains relevant nowadays.

""But on the flip side, some traditional kuih raya may fall into obscurity as modern adaptations take centre stage. Classic flavours like kuih bangkit and halwa maskat might struggle to compete with trendy, visually appealing treats that go viral online,” he said.

This delicate balancing act between innovation and preservation highlights just how influential content creators have become in shaping festive tastes and habits.

""Ultimately, these influencers are playing a crucial role,” said Muhammad Rezza. ""They act as digital custodians of food culture. Whether preserving tradition or pushing for innovation, they’re making Malaysian festive treats more exciting, accessible, and appreciated. - BERNAMA",1.74578E+12,en,0.405808508,2025-04-27

PayNet's Program Akar builds digital talent pipeline for financial sector's future

Expanding a role it has never played before in its almost eight year existence, that of talent provider for the financial sector, Payments Network Malaysia Sdn Bhd (PayNet) has launched the second phase of its national talent development initiative, Program Akar (the Malay language word for 'root'), with a new focus on artificial intelligence and data science for Malaysia's financial services industry. The six weeks program, fully funded by PayNet, will see 100 students selected.

Powered by Microsoft's AI for Malaysia's Future (AIForMYFuture) initiative, the curriculum aims to equip university students with practical skills in digital payments, AI, and industry applications, preparing them for roles in the rapidly evolving financial sector.

""We see talent development as national development,"" said Farhan Ahmad, Group CEO of PayNet, meaning that the country's development will be stunted if it cannot create the talent needed by industry to power its growth and progress. Hence Farhan declaring, ""Program Akar is about more than preparing students for jobs, it's about preparing them to lead Malaysia's digital economy with purpose.""

The students seem ready for the challenge, going by the response of Amir Hibban, a Multimedia University (MMU) student. Sharing his enthusiasm at being chosen, he said, ""Being selected for Program Akar feels like a big step forward. It's not everyday you get the chance to learn about AI and digital payments from real industry leaders. I'm excited to see how this can shape my future and help me find my place in Malaysia's digital economy.""

According to PayNet, the success of the program will be measured by students' ability to secure internships or employment opportunities in the financial services sector. By connecting students to hands-on learning, mentorship, and job placements within Malaysia's leading financial institutions, Program Akar aims to strengthen the country's financial ecosystem and build long-term economic resilience in an increasingly AI-driven landscape.

Akar's first cohort for 2025 begins with 25 students from MMU serving as the pilot group. PayNet plans to expand the program to include 75 more students from other local universities by the end of the year.

Microsoft partnership brings AI focus

""AI is transforming every role in every industry, including financial services. By collaborating with PayNet through Program Akar, we're helping build a generation of talent equipped with digital and AI skills to thrive in line with Microsoft's AIForMYFuture initiative,"" said Laurence Si, Managing Director of Microsoft Malaysia.

This second installment of Akar integrates Microsoft's AI learning pathways as part of Malaysia's broader digital skilling efforts. The program is delivered by implementation partners PEOPLElogy Bhd and Futuresparx Sdn Bhd.

Microsoft, which introduced its ""AI for Malaysia's Future"" initiative in Dec 2024, ambitiously aims to equip 800,000 Malaysians with AI skills by the end of 2025 and was an obvious choice for PayNet to partner.

Comprehensive curriculum addressing industry needs

Program Akar equips students with a three-pillar curriculum focused on:

Values-Driven Enrichment – Cultivating leadership, integrity, and a future-ready mindset

Digital Payment Knowledge – Covering the evolution of money, banking systems, digital payments, and transaction security

AI & Data Science Mastery – Combining foundational knowledge with critical thinking and real-world applications

The curriculum was designed in response to feedback from financial industry partners following the initial cohort that was launched in July 2024, which focused primarily on digital payments and cloud technologies through a collaboration with AWS.

While the Digital Payment Knowledge and AI & Data Science Mastery pillars are obvious areas of focus, Jun Maria Tan Abdullah, Senior Director of Program Akar, explained the importance of the values-driven component, which was added after feedback from participating companies in the first cohort: ""Critical thinking is key. The students need to be more creative and proactive because once they get it, they'll learn very fast. We must not just focus on the technology but also on giving them power skills to be more holistic.""

Students from the Kuala Lumpur-based Asia Pacific University of Technology & Innovation (APU) were chosen for the July 2024 cohort with 50 computing and IT students selected from about 150 applicants through an assessment and interview process. The program consisted of 47 days of training with two days of physical and 45 days of virtual learning. They then had a three month placement with financial institutions in the country. According to APU's estimate, the fully sponsored training was worth US$2,743 (RM12,000) for each student.

When asked if PayNet will offer non-technical programs under Akar, Jun said, ""We're trying to solve the talent problem that we have in the financial services industry, where we are struggling to get good technical digital talent, so we will solve that first.""



Selection process for candidates

The program is open to Malaysian Bachelor's Degree students in their penultimate or final year who are seeking internship or placement opportunities. Applicants must meet specific criteria:

Minimum CGPA of 3.00

Currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in IT, Computer Science, or technology-related programs

Qualified candidates undergo both technical and behavioral assessments to evaluate their hard and soft skills.

PayNet, Malaysia's national payments network, processes transactions worth US$1.4 trillion (RM6.1 trillion) annually — equivalent to 3.3 times Malaysia's GDP. Its retail payments ecosystem includes services like DuitNow, JomPAY, and MyDebit that form a core part of daily financial transactions in the country. The company also manages Malaysia's real-time retail QR payments network, which is interoperable with systems in Singapore, Thailand, and Indonesia.

outbreak,Omoda 3 revealed – new sporty compact crossover; global launch in October 2025; coming to Malaysia?,1.74566E+12,Paul Tan,paultan.org,https://news.google.com/read/CBMiYEFVX3lxTFBCOTdQd0puRk5nZW91Z0p5Y3BsZ21jVllXb1lLaTdlNVVFeDQ4Smg3RzhIZUdPN0FWY2ttUmNRb24waURaRzMxMWYwUE56N0pXdk5tN081NHpid1ZRbnp1SA?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://paultan.org/2025/04/26/omoda-3-world-debut/,"Posted in Cars, Chery, International News / By Gerard Lye / April 26 2025 6:08 pm

Chery today unveiled the Omoda 3, a new crossover that is meant to slot in below the Omoda 5 and 7. Alternatively known as the C3 depending on the market it is sold in (the Omoda 5 and 7 are also known as the C5 and C7), the crossover is meant to appeal to youths and was designed by a team of designers that have an average age of 28 years, according to Roy Xie, the model’s brand director.

Inspired by “starships,” the Omoda 3’s styling isn’t short of angles and sharp creases. We can’t help but think that the Lamborghini Urus may have been a source of inspiration for the aggressive aesthetic.

The front of the new crossover features slim daytime running lights that are positioned above the main headlamps. The latter is visually connected to a large black panel in the middle that has an air inlet opening at the bottom with vertical slats.

As for the rear, the L-shaped taillights are connected by a light bar on the tailgate, both adopting a lightning-style signature. Angular wheel arch surround, flush door handles and blacked-out C-pillars are just some of cues on the sides of the vehicle.

Inside, the Omoda 3 sports a wraparound ‘Starship Cockpit’ with ambient lighting running from door card to door card and across the dashboard above the air vents. A digital instrument cluster and a large central touchscreen are also present, the latter for the connected infotainment system.

One design cue that is clearly taken from Lamborghini is the push start button on the centre console that has a red cover over it. This is surrounded by buttons for quick access to selected vehicle controls.

In other areas, the climate controls are integrated into the touchscreen and gear selection is done via a stalk coming of the steering column on the count of the emotive start-up sequence. Xie also points out the Omoda 3’s ‘Starship Commander Seat’, gaming-ready cabin and a wide ecosystem of customisation options that include paint schemes and accessories.

The Omoda 3 is being introduced as a global model that will be launched in various markets outside of China from October this year. We weren’t presented with powertrain details or additional information during the presentation, but we will update this space as we find out more. For now, what do you think of the Omoda 3? Are you hoping it comes to Malaysia? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

He said the electric multiple unit (EMU) sets were currently undergoing technical tests, including dynamic and fault-free testing.

“If all the tests proceed smoothly, the trains are expected to begin operations by August.

“Apart from the first two sets, the remaining eight are being assembled in stages at the China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation (CRRC) plant in Batu Gajah.

“All 10 sets are expected to be completed and fully operational by early next year to enhance the country’s rail service capacity,” he said in a statement here today.

Earlier, he visited the Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad (KTMB) depot in Batu Gajah.

Loke said the CRRC plant in Batu Gajah now employed more than 85 per cent local workers, reflecting strong potential for the transfer of knowledge and expertise to local talent.

The Society of Cement and Concrete Researchers in Nigeria (SCCRIN) has called for the adoption of Limestone Calcined Clay Cement (LC3) as a critical solution in the fight against climate change.

Bags of cement

The researchers made the call on Thursday, April 24, 2025, in Abuja at the LC3 Day Nigeria.

The event was organised by SCCRIN in conjunction with the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Lagos, and Department of Civil Engineering, African University of Science and Technology, Abuja.

Prof. Azikiwe Onwualu, President, African University of Science and Technology, Abuja, said the call to switch to LC3 was necessary because the production of conventional cement had a number of negative issues.

Onwualu said the process involved releasing of bad gases into the atmosphere thereby contributing to the effects of climate change.

He said that conventional cement production accounted for CO? emissions, mostly due to the high-temperature in processing it.

According to him, other hand, LC3 uses a combination of limestone, calcined clay, and gypsum, drastically lowering the need for energy-intensive clinker.

“The idea now is looking for alternatives to conventional cement. Of course, the conventional cement is serving us, but the change is because of the environmental issues associated with the production.

“We know that if we continue with the current method of producing cement, in the long run, we are threatening the environment, we are threatening the earth,” he said.

According to Olumoh Sharafadeen, one of the organisers of the LC3 Nigeria event and an engineer, the LC3 Nigeria event was put together by cement and concrete researchers in Nigeria to create awareness on environmentally friendly building materials.

Sharafadeen said this would assist in achieving a greener future and ensuring that environmental hazards were curtailed.

He explained that carbon credits were being awarded to countries based on their low carbon emission practices, so, when Nigeria adopts LC3, it would benefit from such award.

He said that SCCRIN collaborated with the universities to bring the LC3 research to light and avoid just having researches kept on the shelves of universities.

Sharafadeen called on government, the biggest player in the industry. to take advantage of the LC3 innovation research and help the industry to grow and achieve an economic diversity .

Also speaking, Dr Efegbidiki Okobia, National President, Nigeria Environmental Society, said the LC3 innovation was apt because of the reduction of carbon dioxide emission from cement production, looking at the global concern on climate change.

Okobia said it had a lot of implications with regards to environmental and public health.

“The LC3 cement will cover some critical environmental challenges and help in the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, which is supposed to come into play as a full completed project by 2030.” he said.

Diamond Dreams is an upcoming lux match-three hitting soft launch this weekend

It mixes lush visuals and a more minimalist style

Can this distinctive take on match-three draw an audience?

Frequent readers may recall that a few weeks ago that we covered the upcoming Lux match-three release, Diamond Dreams. Coming from GFAL (Games for a Living), this interesting spin on the format is now set to move from beta to soft launch, arriving over the weekend in Malaysia.

So, what exactly is a luxury match-three? Well, in essence, it's everything you'd expect from the genre but much, much flashier. The gems you bust are rendered in glittering, high-res fashion, and you clear levels to acquire diamonds that can then be used to create virtual jewellery (rendered by the same guy behind the jewels in the opening of The Crown).

As noted by our editor, Dann Sullivan, in his preview of GFAL's match-three puzzler, Diamond Dreams' greatest strength appears to be in how it distinguishes itself from the competition. Be it the aforementioned lush visuals, font or minimalist menu style.

Diamond Dreams also boasts Web3 integration, which allows you to trade your created jewellery with other players. While that's certainly an interesting choice, it is unlikely to be what truly draws in a wider audience. What might be a pull is the mixture of challenging difficulty and the actual luxury aesthetic of Diamond Dreams that would make it stand out.

If you're looking to get into it and you're in Malaysia, then you'll want to keep an eye out for Diamond Dreams as it's planned to hit soft launch over the weekend, pending app review. The previously available beta version of the app will no longer function as of today, however.

outbreak,NGO rues politicisation of education in Malaysia,1.74562E+12,Free Malaysia Today,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,https://news.google.com/read/CBMirwFBVV95cUxNSUNHa3c3WDNlSC1uUVZMYTdnbW9BTnBOb1pRVjVQcURHQnliVmgwTHpVdjZBQ0s4MTB5TXZGdkJHQVRBbXRNMkcxRDh0dXQ1Rzl0Q21pMFc5UlZWUHJ3b1RYQUZDaGdpTzRwZTI4RUpYSjMzd3k5WXhlMVNtZE4xRU9KX1BpdXNVVklVc0ZMYUdJY1B1c2VSWjFra3pFUDFnMC1teFdkd1VLWWxhLTZR?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2025/04/26/ngo-rues-politicisation-of-education-in-malaysia,"National schools are now seen as ‘Malay territory’, while vernacular schools are perceived as domains of the Chinese and Indians, according to Fazar Arif.

PETALING JAYA : A Sabah-based NGO has singled out the politicisation of education as the factor that has divided Malaysia along racial lines.

Fazar Arif, founder of Pergerakan Orang Wanita — Empowerment and Revolution, claims that the racial politics practised today has had a significant impact on the curriculum, education policy and management of schools.

She claimed that national schools, envisioned as the great unifier after Merdeka, have increasingly taken on religious and racial undertones, and alienated non-Malay and non-Muslim students in the process.

She said such developments have led to certain stereotypes being attached to national and vernacular schools, with the former widely seen as “Malay territory” and the latter perceived as the domain of their respective ethnic groups.

This, she said, has promoted segregation.

“Even when students from other races enrol (in national schools), they remain a small minority,” Fazar told FMT.

She said the “self-reinforcing” cycle would reduce interaction among students of different racial backgrounds from an early age.

“They grow up in parallel worlds — with different religions, different languages, different histories, and different cultural celebrations. Segregation in the school system is very real,” she added.

Fazar was commenting on the introduction of a new policy requiring students to wear the Jalur Gemilang badge on their uniform, a practice that the government says will foster unity.

Need for action

Fazar warned that the divide within society, starting from the younger generation, will continue to widen if such segregation is not dealt with.

“Integration becomes more difficult when there are barriers separating religions, languages, cultures and traditions,” she said.

Fazar also bemoaned the fact that none of today’s politicians know how to fix it.

“They don’t seem to have a clue on how to use the school and education system to set aside race and religion and bring about integration among young Malaysians,” she said.

She questioned why no political party, particularly those in the government, has been seen or heard leading serious discussions or conversations among the people or fellow legislators on reforming the education system to foster integration, a more meaningful growth and advancement as a nation.

“How long are Malaysians going to confine themselves to a school system that divides us?”

Need to change the narrative

Fazar also claimed that the current education system tends to push the propaganda of the so-called social contract among the three major races in Malaysia, which she added was another barrier to fostering good race-relations.

She said rectifying the problem created by the politicisation of education would be a monumental task, as it requires political will.

Firstly, she said, there is a need to acknowledge that racial division in the country’s school system is real and that it has been compounded by decades of political interference.

“Otherwise, any solution will be superficial, and things will only continue to deteriorate,” she added.

Secondly, she said, the government must reimagine national schools as truly inclusive institutions.

She pointed out that there is a need to remove racial and religious supremacy narratives from the curriculum and make national schools genuinely secular and multiracial in terms of administration, personnel and curriculum.

“There is a need to ensure all students are fluent in Bahasa Malaysia and English but steps must also be taken to strengthen mother tongue languages, such as Mandarin, Tamil and indigenous languages and making them part of the mainstream curriculum.",1.74569E+12,en,-0.606616795,2025-04-25 23:07:12,"['certain', 'divided', 'vernacular', 'meaningful', 'widen', 'tends', 'early', 'reimagine', 'serious', 'background', 'generation', 'policy', 'age', 'conversation', 'particularly', 'territory', 'race', 'indian', 'wear', 'undertone', 'say', 'pointed', 'founder', 'created', 'inclusive', 'jalur', 'administration', 'task', 'real', 'mandarin', 'continue', 'aside', 'parallel', 'selfreinforcing', 'heard', 'decade', 'step', 'unity', 'dont', 'social', 'use', 'orang', 'celebration', 'fmt', 'becomes', 'clue', 'going', 'confine', 'another', 'none', 'dealt', 'unifier', 'requiring', 'racerelations', 'tradition', 'foster', 'fluent', 'religion', 'uniform', 'arif', 'taken', 'world', 'bring', 'attached', 'grow', 'within', 'political', 'change', 'term', 'questioned', 'requires', 'wanita', 'must', 'propaganda', 'added', 'difficult', 'gemilang', 'current', 'malaysian', 'perceived', 'three', 'deteriorate', 'respective', 'supremacy', 'promoted', 'cultural', 'latter', 'secondly', 'also', 'good', 'merdeka', 'management', 'truly', 'claim', 'sabahbased', 'alienated', 'different', 'student', 'push', 'barrier', 'stereotype', 'starting', 'seem', 'multiracial', 'bahasa', 'legislator', 'superficial', 'politics', 'racial', 'today', 'group', 'chinese', 'segregation', 'major', 'secular', 'english', 'factor', 'know', 'long', 'rectifying', 'petaling', 'significant', 'party', 'impact', 'nonmuslim', 'set', 'personnel', 'pergerakan', 'otherwise', 'make', 'envisioned', 'led', 'society', 'discussion', 'revolution', 'fix', 'monumental', 'malay', 'warned', 'reforming', 'contract', 'widely', 'enrol', 'socalled', 'among', 'indigenous', 'religious', 'development', 'nation', 'education', 'jaya', 'domain', 'curriculum', 'leading', 'fostering', 'empowerment', 'need', 'commenting', 'narrative', 'country', 'action', 'separating', 'strengthen', 'introduction', 'mother', 'divide', 'integration', 'ensure', 'young', 'mainstream', 'badge', 'people', 'thing', 'remove', 'claimed', 'ngo', 'minority', 'national', 'growth', 'fact', 'former', 'remain', 'would', 'culture', 'interference', 'practised', 'solution', 'according', 'institution', 'system', 'part', 'great', 'government', 'politician', 'reduce', 'interaction', 'nonmalay', 'practice', 'bemoaned', 'school', 'cycle', 'tongue', 'fellow', 'problem', 'younger', 'genuinely', 'line', 'advancement', 'language', 'history', 'politicisation', 'malaysia', 'division', 'said', 'compounded', 'increasingly', 'firstly', 'even', 'along', 'acknowledge', 'seen', 'new', 'process', 'making', 'fazar', 'small', 'told', 'tamil', 'singled', 'ethnic']",Negative

Last week, Chinese President Xi Jinping and government partners visited Malaysia to sign new partnership agreements for joint development of emerging technologies. In relation, China has agreed to share rare earth processing tech with Malaysia. The last time Jinping was in the country was in 2013.

“They are very keen to work with us,” Lih Kang told Malaysian state-owned media company Bernama on Wednesday. “President Xi Jinping has also explicitly stated that China will assist us in developing the processing technology.”

Malaysia is currently estimated to hold 16.1 million tonnes of rare earth reserves, valued at approximately US$168 billion. There are substantial deposits of neodymium, dysprosium and praseodymium waiting to be exploited. But, lacking the necessary processing equipment has been holding the country back.

“If we sell rare earth raw and unprocessed, the value is relatively low, but once processed, its value increases significantly, by as much as 10 to 15 times,” a Malaysian government official told reporters in Selangor on Apr. 17

Despite lacking the technological prowess of the Chinese in the sector, Malaysia already currently hosts the world’s largest rare earth processing plant outside of China. Lynas Rare Earths Ltd (ASX: LYC) (OTCMKTS: LYSDY) (FRA: LYI) operates and maintains it.

“As the global economy pivots toward electrification, green energy, and advanced technologies, rare earth elements are fast becoming the backbone of innovation — powering everything from electric vehicles to semiconductors and aerospace,” Lih Kang said on social media this week.

“Malaysia, with its natural reserves and growing R&D ecosystem, stands at the threshold of tremendous opportunity.”

Chinese export ban & U.S. trade war make rare earths popular topic

China’s recent decision to suspend exports of seven crucial rare earth elements (REE) has put Malaysia in the spotlight.

The Southeast Asian nation is currently limiting its exports of unprocessed rare earths, but still ships refined rare metals abroad.

The industry is expected to contribute US$2 billion to Malaysia’s GDP this year.

“Recently, Malaysia has gained more prominence due to its REE reserves,” the Malaysian Investment Development Authority has highlighted. “Malaysia’s domestic rare earth minerals are seen to be a step forward as the world seeks to reduce reliance on China.”

The global market for rare earths is expected to reach a valuation of US$11.6 billion by the end of next year. The Americans used to get over three quarters of their rare earths from China.

Where does the U.S. get its rare earths? – China – up to 80%

– Estonia – ~10%

– Malaysia – ~10%

– Australia – ~5%

– Mountain Pass, CA – only active U.S. mine, still reliant on China for processing We mine a little. China refines a lot. https://t.co/cD3VMxcjsm — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) April 4, 2025

Malaysia has chosen the iconic Bukit Jalil Stadium, with a capacity of 85,500 to host Vietnam in their highly anticipated match of the 2027 Asian Cup final qualifying round in June.

In their opening game on March 25, Malaysia defeated Nepal 2-0 at Sultan Ibrahim Stadium, which holds 40,000 spectators. But for the crucial home clash against Vietnam, the team will return to Bukit Jalil, a venue that has both scale and atmosphere.

Malaysia national team CEO Rob Friend expressed confidence that the stadium's size and energy will give his side a competitive edge in this important match.

The Malaysia national team's official website said they hope that supporters will flood the stadium in a sea of black and yellow, the team's traditional colors.

""Back to our fortress. An exciting clash against Vietnam awaits,"" wrote MalaysiaNT.

The New Straits Times also emphasized Bukit Jalil's significance, stating that the stadium's electric atmosphere could help Malaysia overcome ""one of the strongest teams in Southeast Asia.""

In Group F, Vietnam and Malaysia are considered direct rivals for the sole qualifying spot to the 2027 Asian Cup. Vietnam currently top the group after a dominant 5-0 win over Laos, while Malaysia trail with a 2-0 victory against Nepal.

Between 2018 and 2021, the Vietnam–Malaysia rivalry was fierce under coaches Park Hang-seo and Tan Cheng Hoe. However, Vietnam have since established dominance, defeating Malaysia 3-0 in both the 2020 and 2022 AFF Cup (now ASEAN Cup) group stages.

Malaysia are undergoing a rebuilding phase, adding more mixed-blood players into the team, in hopes of closing the gap with regional powerhouses like Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia. Their new coach, Peter Cklamovski, has acknowledged Vietnam's superior pace and quality.

Bukit Jalil in southern Kuala Lumpur opened in 1998 and is the largest stadium in Southeast Asia and the fourth largest in Asia, with a capacity of 85,500. Only India's Narendra Modi Stadium (132,000), North Korea's Rungrado May 1st Stadium (114,000) and Qatar's Lusail Stadium (88,966) are larger.

Known as a ""cauldron"" for its crazy atmosphere, Bukit Jalil is home to the passionate Ultras Malaya, widely considered one of the most passionate football supporter communities in Asia. These fans create an intimidating atmosphere by chanting, singing and waving flags non-stop throughout matches.

Vietnam's last trip to Bukit Jalil was for the first leg of the 2018 AFF Cup final, which drew a staggering 88,482 spectators. Despite taking a 2-0 lead, Vietnam allowed Malaysia to claw back to a 2-2 draw amid a thunderous atmosphere that left players unable to hear instructions from the coaching staff.

Since 1991, Vietnam have faced Malaysia 23 times, winning 15, drawing three and losing five. Vietnam's last defeat was a 2-4 loss in the 2014 AFF Cup semifinals at Hanoi's My Dinh Stadium. Since then, Vietnam have won six matches and drawn once.",1.74578E+12,en,0.462199658,2025-04-26 23:00:00,"['lead', 'stage', 'time', 'mixedblood', 'flood', 'staff', 'direct', 'asean', 'scale', 'bukit', 'color', 'strait', 'side', 'highly', 'larger', 'hear', 'ibrahim', 'defeating', 'southeast', 'friend', 'luong', 'thunderous', 'sea', 'ceo', 'india', 'jalils', 'drew', 'return', 'crucial', 'cheng', 'acknowledged', 'largest', 'defeated', 'energy', 'cauldron', 'june', 'lumpur', 'trail', 'modi', 'winning', 'last', 'cklamovski', 'throughout', 'clash', 'team', 'atmosphere', 'cup', 'stadium', 'trip', 'allowed', 'victory', 'may', 'hope', 'win', 'tan', 'staggering', 'asia', 'nonstop', 'football', 'park', 'three', 'significance', 'could', 'dominance', 'taking', 'drawn', 'malaysiant', 'thailand', 'superior', 'also', 'since', 'pace', 'venue', 'official', 'leg', 'korea', 'coaching', 'edge', 'claw', 'considered', 'rebuilding', 'regional', 'final', 'drawing', 'sole', 'flag', 'one', 'group', 'chanting', 'host', 'strongest', 'instruction', 'player', 'loss', 'ultras', 'faced', 'set', 'lusail', 'unable', 'jalil', 'march', 'important', 'hold', 'challenge', 'nepal', 'sultan', 'chosen', 'rungrado', 'competitive', 'vnexpresshieu', 'dec', 'game', 'coach', 'however', 'qualifying', 'closing', 'widely', 'rob', 'emphasized', 'confidence', 'known', 'draw', 'defeat', 'fortress', 'traditional', 'wrote', 'semifinal', 'aff', 'round', 'fierce', 'anticipated', 'stating', 'exciting', 'website', 'adding', 'first', 'supporter', 'create', 'qualifier', 'six', 'narendra', 'amid', 'passionate', 'rivalry', 'dinh', 'capacity', 'losing', 'waving', 'despite', 'vietnam', 'iconic', 'phase', 'national', 'black', 'fourth', 'help', 'fan', 'vietnammalaysia', 'size', 'qatar', 'community', 'five', 'asian', 'north', 'awaits', 'give', 'kuala', 'hanoi', 'rival', 'home', 'dominant', 'top', 'lao', 'hoe', 'gap', 'indonesia', 'peter', 'spectator', 'back', 'match', 'powerhouse', 'malaysia', 'hangseo', 'said', 'crazy', 'spot', 'photo', 'opening', 'established', 'expressed', 'undergoing', 'currently', 'quality', 'southern', 'new', 'malaya', 'overcome', 'intimidating', 'singing', 'left', 'yellow', 'like', 'electric', 'opened']",Neutral

The successful collaboration between the health ministries of Malaysia and Thailand, industry partners in Egypt and Malaysia, and the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) to bring a new hepatitis C antiviral drug – ravidasvir – to market in 2022 was an important milestone. For years, a 12-week course of treatment using sofosbuvir cost between $70,000 and $80,000, putting it out of reach for many in the Global South. But ravidasvir – a safe and effective alternative when combined with sofosbuvir – costs far less, averaging less than $500 per course.This type of South-South co-operation could serve as a model for developing countries with endemic disease, highlighting how collective action can help them address health challenges and promote medical innovation. As this year’s chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), Malaysia plans to advance the agenda of collaborative, need-driven research, and foster the development of therapeutics and diagnostics in the Global South.Ravidasvir’s success depended on several factors. First, DNDi worked with an Egyptian drug manufacturer to develop the molecule, which was originally produced in the US but overlooked by large pharmaceutical companies. Second, once it became clear that this R&D initiative would produce an independent, affordable treatment for hepatitis C, the Malaysian Ministry of Health (where I am Director-General of Health), together with DNDi leadership in Southeast Asia, designed an aggressive access strategy based on market competition, driving down the prices of three treatment options. Throughout the process, Global South partners were in the driver’s seat.This sense of ownership prompted a flurry of activity in Malaysia, ultimately lowering the barriers between siloed government departments and dispelling conventional thinking. For example, our regulatory authority was the first to register the combination of ravidasvir and sofosbuvir without approval by a stringent regulatory authority. Pharmaniaga, a Malaysian generic-drugs manufacturer, supported these efforts by taking on the challenge of preparing a registration dossier for a new chemical entity.The Malaysian health ministry has continued to advance this treatment option. In February, the ministry unveiled results from a clinical trial showing that a shorter regimen (eight as opposed to 12 weeks) of sofobusvir-ravidasvir treatment was not inferior in non-cirrhotic hepatitis C patients. This represents a big win for those living with the disease in the Global South, as it lowers the therapeutic cost even further and improves patient compliance.While making treatment affordable and accessible is an important step toward eliminating hepatitis C, the same needs to be done for diagnostic tools. Traditional lab-based testing is expensive and logistically challenging for mass screening programmes across Southeast Asia. But instead of waiting for high-income countries to develop solutions, the Global South should take the lead in innovating point-of-care diagnostics that are inexpensive and scalable.The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the fragility of global medical-supply chains and the limits of solidarity among countries in the face of a public-health crisis. The Global North’s reluctance to share vaccines, tests, personal protective equipment, and therapeutics fuelled an “every country for itself” mentality. As a result, a credibility crisis has consumed the global health system, now exacerbated by a widening funding gap, largely owing to America’s recent withdrawal from the World Health Organisation. The need for new models has never been clearer.Recognising the need for greater regional resilience, Southeast Asian countries have shown an increasing willingness to support clinical trials and boost local manufacturing of medical devices and pharmaceuticals. Malaysia has played a central role in these efforts. In July 2024, the Malaysian government hosted a workshop with the United Kingdom’s Academy of Medical Sciences to explore strategies for improving diagnostic and therapeutic access in the region. Workshop attendees recommended establishing a product-development partnership to foster collaboration among governments, academia, and industry.In May, Clinical Research Malaysia, a research management organisation under the health ministry that has focused on building clinical-trial capacity across the country – including for first-in-human phase 1 studies – will host CRM Trial Connect. Focused on accelerating clinical trials in Asia, the conference will bring together more than 1,000 academics, clinical researchers, industry leaders, and policymakers from across the region.As the current chair of Asean, Malaysia is also well positioned to engage in dialogue with regional and international partners on how to address the Global South’s health challenges. The Asean-Gulf Co-operation Council-China Summit scheduled for May will provide a venue for exploring ways to strengthen South-South collaboration, particularly regarding knowledge and technology transfers and access to medical innovation.The development of ravidasvir offers insights into how regional collaboration and targeted investment can lead to affordable medical innovations, adding to a growing playbook of strategies for improving access to therapeutics and diagnostics in the Global South. If these countries agree to act collectively, they can likely repeat this success for a wide range of neglected and non-communicable diseases – and take ownership of a process long dominated by the Global North.",1.74569E+12,en,0.457361579,2025-04-25 20:59:00,"['equipment', 'attendee', 'pointofcare', 'central', 'cooperation', 'market', 'develop', 'consumed', 'explore', 'safe', 'far', 'muhammad', 'connect', 'investment', 'widening', 'foster', 'option', 'bring', 'throughout', 'world', 'hassan', 'crm', 'researcher', 'win', 'malaysian', 'together', 'dndi', 'stringent', 'living', 'crisis', 'venue', 'sofosbuvir', 'wide', 'egyptian', 'july', 'noncommunicable', 'ministry', 'factor', 'combined', 'credibility', 'focused', 'test', 'labbased', 'provide', 'never', 'lowering', 'withdrawal', 'ultimately', 'effective', 'development', 'nation', 'milestone', 'effort', 'device', 'positioned', 'health', 'manufacturing', 'fragility', 'first', 'manufacturer', 'successful', 'country', 'regulatory', 'testing', 'research', 'toward', 'solidarity', 'screening', 'large', 'therapeutic', 'neglected', 'solution', 'partner', 'molecule', 'summit', 'collectively', 'firstinhuman', 'growing', 'take', 'largely', 'accelerating', 'initiative', 'shown', 'industry', 'malaysia', 'even', 'antiviral', 'across', 'organisation', 'putting', 'southsouth', 'southeast', 'tool', 'exacerbated', 'conference', 'collaboration', 'conventional', 'face', 'boost', 'programme', 'leader', 'type', 'limit', 'current', 'radzi', 'three', 'taking', 'abu', 'innovating', 'international', 'transfer', 'based', 'increasing', 'aseangulf', 'showing', 'association', 'endemic', 'model', 'mass', 'accessible', 'produced', 'egypt', 'unveiled', 'important', 'challenge', 'partnership', 'lower', 'depended', 'independent', 'region', 'cost', 'academy', 'result', 'authority', 'global', 'building', 'sofobusvirravidasvir', 'waiting', 'highincome', 'access', 'entitythe', 'example', 'preparing', 'compliancewhile', 'productdevelopment', 'success', 'dominated', 'disease', 'help', 'personal', 'southravidasvirs', 'funding', 'affordable', 'system', 'aggressive', 'government', 'councilchina', 'fuelled', 'needdriven', 'targeted', 'local', 'thinking', 'coursethis', 'reach', 'eight', 'gap', 'engage', 'treatment', 'challenging', 'trial', 'recommended', 'lead', 'asean', 'ownership', 'including', 'hepatitis', 'particularly', 'combination', 'driving', 'instead', 'scalablethe', 'clinicaltrial', 'agree', 'step', 'highlighting', 'chain', 'act', 'covid', 'offer', 'protective', 'chair', 'playbook', 'course', 'industryin', 'directorgeneral', 'sense', 'mentality', 'register', 'serve', 'range', 'patient', 'played', 'address', 'greater', 'regarding', 'academic', 'prompted', 'highlighted', 'host', 'clear', 'less', 'technology', 'ravidasvir', 'role', 'produce', 'registration', 'among', 'repeat', 'big', 'support', 'traditional', 'alternative', 'resilience', 'adding', 'need', 'price', 'done', 'action', 'strengthen', 'promote', 'originally', 'activity', 'every', 'dialogue', 'south', 'academia', 'strategy', 'pharmaceutical', 'phase', 'seatthis', 'study', 'recent', 'america', 'asian', 'inexpensive', 'scheduled', 'averaging', 'hosted', 'likely', 'competition', 'dispelling', 'several', 'department', 'many', 'designed', 'making', 'new', 'using', 'process', 'per', 'supported', 'regionas', 'knowledge', 'diagnostics', 'insight', 'became', 'pharmaniaga', 'way', 'workshop', 'leadership', 'medical', 'collective', 'approval', 'driver', 'plan', 'inferior', 'represents', 'year', 'establishing', 'may', 'asia', 'genericdrugs', 'could', 'clinical', 'thailand', 'also', 'eliminating', 'management', 'advance', 'regional', 'science', 'agenda', 'dossier', 'barrier', 'policymakers', 'medicalsupply', 'united', 'publichealth', 'long', 'owing', 'diagnostic', 'improves', 'kingdom', 'improving', 'well', 'without', 'chemical', 'opposed', 'clearerrecognising', 'exploring', 'innovationthe', 'innovation', 'overlooked', 'capacity', 'expensive', 'week', 'drug', 'company', 'would', 'vaccine', 'collaborative', 'share', 'shorter', 'north', 'second', 'siloed', 'february', 'reluctance', 'noncirrhotic', 'willingness', 'flurry', 'worked', 'logistically', 'developing', 'pandemic', 'continued', 'regimen']",Neutral

KUALA LUMPUR, April 27 -- The Malaysia Cup final descended into chaos last night before a ball was even kicked, as rival fans of Johor Darul Ta'zim (JDT) and Sri Pahang FC clashed violently outside the Bukit Jalil Stadium here.

What began as a heated exchange escalated into a full-blown brawl at the Axiata Arena entrance.

Witnesses reported scenes of mayhem as traffic cones were ripped from their places and hurled through the air, while flares were ignited and waved dangerously close to the crowd, setting an ominous tone ahead of the country's most prestigious football showdown.

Videos that have since gone viral on social media show furious supporters from both sides exchanging punches and kicks as barricades meant to separate the groups were easily breached.

The situation spiraled out of control within minutes, forcing police and Rela personnel to intervene to break up the melee and restore order.

According to initial news reports, the clash was sparked when a group of JDT fans were allegedly provoked by a small faction of Pahang supporters near the Sri Pahang entrance gates.

Tempers flared, and with neither side backing down, the confrontation quickly devolved into chaos.

Despite the off-field drama, the final itself lived up to its billing, delivering a thrilling contest that saw JDT crowned champions after a 2-1 comeback victory over Sri Pahang.

Pahang coach Fandi Ahmad later revealed that the turning point of the night for his team came early, lamenting the loss of key player Sergio Aguero to a red card in the first half.

Aguero, who had already been booked, was shown a second yellow in quick succession at the 35th minute -- a controversial decision that left Sri Pahang a man down while they were leading 1-0 through T. Saravanan's strike.

""We came here to fight, and the players gave two hundred percent on the field,"" Fandi was quoted by Malay newspaper Kosmo! Online after the match.

(EPA Images pic)

KUALA LUMPUR : When Fahmi Faat’s family in Kuala Lumpur prepared only half their usual amount of food for recent Eid al-Fitr celebrations, he blamed an ongoing shortage of coconuts, a staple ingredient in many Asian cuisines.

“Fresh coconut milk was very limited during Eid,” said the 45-year-old restaurant manager, who had to make less of signature dishes like beef rendang.

“I could only buy three packets instead of six and it wasn’t enough.”

Poor weather in some of the world’s top growers has hurt production, shrinking global supplies and, in some places, doubling prices of the increasingly sought-after tropical fruit.

Some producing countries like the Philippines and Indonesia are considering export restrictions, while consumers are being urged to switch to alternatives of the ingredient used in everyday cooking and a range of products like vegan milk and energy drinks.

The world’s biggest coconut producer, the Philippines, expects a 20% decline in output this year.

That’s because for the past two years, extreme weather – from drought to tropical cyclones – has strained trees like those on the southern coastal plantations of one of its largest exporters.

“The main reason behind the low supply is climate-driven,” Henry Raperoga, president and chief operating officer of Axelum Resources Corp, said an email.

“These events have led to reduced yields, delayed harvests and limited farmer mobility.”

The Philippine Coconut Authority said it’s in talks with producers about keeping a portion of their coconut oil for domestic use before allowing exports.

“This proposed scheme is intended to secure local supply and stabilise prices without disrupting our export commitments,” the agency said in a statement.

Other producers like Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam are also seeing supplies constrained by weather issues and higher domestic consumption, Raperoga added.

In second biggest producer Indonesia, the industry ministry has proposed a three-to-six month export ban, levies on outbound shipments, and benchmark pricing to stabilise local prices that have skyrocketed 150% in the past three months.

Wholesale prices at a weekly auction in the Sri Lankan capital have more than doubled over the past year after a crop shortfall caused by a combination of poor weather and disease.

The government in February granted a request from producers to import coconut kernels to help ease market pressure.

Global demand, meanwhile, is expected to keep climbing thanks to the coconut’s reputation as a tasty lactose-free and plant-based option, according to Axelum, which counts the US as its largest market and is also seeing growing sales in Europe and Latin America.

Related products like coconut oil, milk and dessicated flakes are also gaining popularity thanks to wellness and sustainability trends.

Coconut oil consumption is expected to rise slightly to 3.23 million tons this year from 3.2 million a year ago, according to the International Coconut Community, with the US, EU and China importing the most.

The US department of agriculture forecasts global stockpiles of coconut oil to close the 2024-25 season at a four-year low.

The squeeze has already translated to soaring prices of coconut oil, which have doubled since 2023 to trade at three-year highs of US$2,658 a ton, according to data from Commodity3.

That’s causing some traders in Malaysia to temporarily shutter operations, with consumers urged to switch to alternatives like cooking cream or yogurt for curries, sauces and cakes, according to local media.

For restaurant manager Fahmi, that’s just not good enough.

“Coconut milk is the heartbeat of Malaysian food,” he says.

“If you change or replace fresh coconut milk, the taste fails.”",1.7457E+12,en,-0.576414287,2025-04-26 00:35:06,"['shutter', 'biggest', 'family', 'switch', 'philippine', 'flake', 'email', 'supply', 'consumption', 'china', 'fails', 'sustainability', 'doubling', 'disrupting', 'high', 'epa', 'amount', 'exporter', 'allowing', 'combination', 'translated', 'instead', 'cooking', 'import', 'ease', 'delayed', 'say', 'squeeze', 'climbing', 'export', 'yield', 'market', 'coastal', 'harvest', 'season', 'trade', 'ago', 'yogurt', 'producing', 'pricing', 'past', 'use', 'largest', 'agriculture', 'celebration', 'grower', 'expected', 'cake', 'officer', 'pressure', 'energy', 'gaining', 'considering', 'outbound', 'lumpur', 'limited', 'already', 'month', 'domestic', 'food', 'proposed', 'lankan', 'threeyear', 'option', 'granted', 'restaurant', 'world', 'year', 'request', 'oil', 'change', 'keeping', 'levy', 'soaring', 'added', 'constrained', 'thanks', 'portion', 'intended', 'malaysian', 'fahmi', 'weather', 'three', 'could', 'event', 'trader', 'blamed', 'milk', 'packet', 'international', 'range', 'thailand', 'popularity', 'also', 'weekly', 'caused', 'stockpile', 'shrinking', 'since', 'temporarily', 'good', 'buy', 'restriction', 'threetosix', 'europe', 'production', 'fruit', 'shipment', 'trend', 'used', 'plantation', 'one', 'operating', 'eid', 'medium', 'ministry', 'hurt', 'shortfall', 'fouryear', 'fresh', 'talk', 'place', 'climatedriven', 'commitment', 'plantbased', 'related', 'meanwhile', 'rise', 'expects', 'output', 'vegan', 'less', 'wholesale', 'issue', 'make', 'two', 'led', 'yearold', 'farmer', 'without', 'secure', 'reduced', 'ingredient', 'prepared', 'forecast', 'rendang', 'everyday', 'alfitr', 'product', 'statement', 'ton', 'agency', 'tasty', 'henry', 'dessicated', 'decline', 'benchmark', 'commodity', 'causing', 'demand', 'enough', 'alternative', 'skyrocketed', 'lactosefree', 'keep', 'faats', 'million', 'manager', 'authority', 'global', 'capital', 'curry', 'drink', 'price', 'axelum', 'higher', 'close', 'six', 'country', 'drought', 'staple', 'corp', 'crop', 'poor', 'pic', 'cream', 'scheme', 'reputation', 'vietnam', 'raperoga', 'wellness', 'disease', 'main', 'help', 'slightly', 'low', 'community', 'tree', 'auction', 'taste', 'according', 'stabilise', 'recent', 'asian', 'america', 'second', 'mobility', 'doubled', 'kuala', 'sauce', 'half', 'government', 'thats', 'dish', 'february', 'shortage', 'behind', 'growing', 'ongoing', 'count', 'cuisine', 'operation', 'beef', 'wasnt', 'importing', 'kernel', 'strained', 'latin', 'seeing', 'top', 'local', 'sri', 'chief', 'data', 'indonesia', 'industry', 'ban', 'usual', 'producer', 'sale', 'said', 'coconut', 'many', 'signature', 'increasingly', 'president', 'department', 'malaysia', 'extreme', 'image', 'cyclone', 'heartbeat', 'urged', 'southern', 'replace', 'tropical', 'resource', 'consumer', 'reason', 'soughtafter', 'like']",Negative

Kota Kinabalu:

Race 1 (Initiation) over 1,100m sandtrack at Tambalang tracks this Sunday sees a heathy crop of promoted runners, Puteri Santubong III, Dynamite and Jelly Jelly with declared ambition to challenge incumbents.

Of the three, Puteri Santubong III is highly regarded and looks sharp going into the race.

Horse owner Chin Kui Sang is highly respected in the circuit, and always prepares his horses well.

Resilient Battle King is tipped to win with Shahbandar Hero and Mountain Ace (Ex. Kante) in the mix.

SPONSORED CONTENT

Race 4 (Class D) over 1,100m sandtrack is suited for Apin Apin Prince for a long overdue win.

He should find Class D competition less intense. His lightning quick gate reaction and front leading style should lead him to glory.

Advertisement

Hunter Champ is consistent-type and has capability to chase down Apin Apin Prince. Gold Dream and Kokorriko should be noticed.

With leading jockey Firdaus in control, in-form Diva can surprise with an upset. Race 5 (Class D) over 1,100m sandtrack will be too close to call with as many as four runners legitimately fighting for top spot. Aqis is favourite with the slightest of edge followed closely by the well-trained Magic Blinks.

Wawa’s impressive runs of two second placings and a third placing qualify her as a strong contender. Go Tommy Go should be tracked even as he moves up to tougher Class D competition.

Over at Selangor Tur Club this Sunday, Royal Sabah Turf Club’s (RSTC) two representatives, Sabah Win and Vittoria Perfetta are scheduled to run Race 2 and Race 10 respectively.

Sabah Win’s excellent record of two consecutive second positions puts him as favourite.

His career thus far at the Capital has been satisfactory and local racing fans will be rooting for Sabah Win for further success.

He faces proven competitors in Kick, Ganbatte and Wan Legacy.

Vittoria Perfetta in Race 10 over 1300m enters this race with modest expectation.

A minor placing will be deemed assignment accomplished. Smoke and Mirrors is favourite with King’s Gambit and Delilah rounding up the selections.

This Sunday in Hong Kong sees the running of the Chairman’s Sprint Prize (Race 5 - International Group 1) with international runners and jockeys participating. Ka Ying Rising, HK’s sprint king undefeated with a sensational record of 11 wins since February 2024 is the horse to beat.

Going after Ka Ying is Japanese horse Satono Reve. Satono Reve with jockey “magic man” Moreira astride can pose a threat to Ka Ying Rising.

Also in contention are Helios Express and Lucky Sweynesse. Race 7 Champions’ Mile (International Group 1) over 1600m should see local favourite Voyage Bubble continuing his dominance over his usual nemesis in Galaxy Patch and My Wish.

Mr Brightside and Royal Patronage, both Australian champions in their own rights, should be closely watched, in particular Mr Brightside.

Race 8 is showpiece race - Queen Elizabeth II Cup (International Group 1) over 2,000m. This race will likely witness the emergence of a champion Japanese horse.

Liberty Island (Japan) is installed as early favourite with Prognosis also from Japan, closely behind. Tastiera, another Japanese stayer, should be pencilled in but Goliath from France under famed Belgian jockey C Soumillon has every intention to gatecrash the Japanese party.

Racing fans can look forward to a bumper weekend of on-course and off-course racing. Local races, Hong Kong, Australia, Selangor and Perak races are teleast “live” at Tambalang Racecourse and RSTC’s Off-Course centres in Tanjung Aru and Keningau.

export,Can the JS-SEZ bridge supply chain barriers amidst global tariff storm?,1.74563E+12,MySinchew,mysinchew.sinchew.com.my,https://news.google.com/read/CBMickFVX3lxTE9sbmFoRDhEOGQxU0V5WGliSnNEVjJQZFRPRXRhcS11T1NsUWZST0xwTmdOMGZscHVELTBDNFVWNFRReXRKZ2lETVdZdnNfRTdPeTdrMEwteUUwM1BRS0hPOGJ5eW9NT09ZZ0ZBTVlUYkl3UQ?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://mysinchew.sinchew.com.my/news/20250426/mysinchew/6483633,"I just returned from a trip to Washington DC. I believe the MITI team had productive engagement sessions on 24 April 2025 with the US Secretary of Commerce, H.E. Howard Lutnick and the US Trade Representative, H.E. Ambassador Jamieson Greer.

Malaysia stands ready to continue collaborating with the United States regarding President Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, and we remain open to negotiations in four key areas: reducing the trade deficit; addressing non-tariff barriers; strengthening technological safeguards and security; and exploring a potential bilateral trade agreement.

Several days ago, on 21—22 April 2025, MITI collaborated with the State of Johor and Singapore’s Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI)—as well as other partners in government and the private sector—to successfully organize the inaugural Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (JS-SEZ) Joint Business and Investment Forum in Johor Bahru.

How do these two events connect? For a start, I mentioned during my keynote at the Forum on how the heart of the Malaysia-Singapore relationship lies in the fact that both countries are at our best when we work together, and there is no better time to strengthen that partnership than through the JS-SEZ, while many countries are searching for the best solutions to ensure a softer economic landing due to US tariffs.

In 2024, Malaysia and Singapore were each other’s second-largest trading partner, while Singapore was Malaysia’s largest export destination.

Our trade in 2024 was a robust US$86.69 billion, driven by E&E products, petroleum products, machinery and others.

Indeed, when Malaysia and Singapore entered the MOU on JS-SEZ in January 2024, no one expected that, 15 months later, President Trump would drop the US reciprocal tariff ‘bomb’ on all its trading partners.

I believe this sentiment was also shared by the 1,000 or so attendees of the two-day JS-SEZ Business Forum.

So, moving forward, how do we leverage on the 3,588-square km JS-SEZ to build resilience in the current global trading scenario?

JS-SEZ’s fundamentals unrivalled

Regardless of what is happening in the world, to Malaysia, the JS-SEZ offers an unbeatable strategic location, connectivity, rule of law, abundant resources and skilled talent to attract high-quality investments in sectors such as advanced manufacturing, logistics, green technology, and digital services into Johor.

For Singapore, it provides space and scale to support its businesses as they expand, leveraging Johor’s land and power availability, as well as Malaysia’s talent pool.

This offers a cross-border ecosystem for MNCs looking for stability, scalability, and sustainability.

I dare say that the JS-SEZ is in a sweet spot, particularly in a situation where Trump’s tariffs are fast changing trade from a bridge to becoming a barrier, and global investors reconfigure their supply chains to make them more resilient.

Thus, we must seize the opportunity to quickly carve out a powerful presence for the JS-SEZ in regional or global supply chains.

Inclusive growth and benefits

Even while we keep engaging with the US, the Madani government has also been diversifying our markets and reforming our economy.

The JS-SEZ plays a crucial role in supporting both objectives.

In economic reforms, for example, MITI regards the JS-SEZ as a massive ‘industrial park’ that will be a perfect launching pad for many of our initiatives under the New Industrial Master Plan 2030 (NIMP2030).

We are also determined to ensure that the bulk of the 20,000 skilled job opportunities are taken up by Malaysians, particularly through initiatives like the Johor Talent Development Council (JTDC).

What about SMEs? During our forum, there was much discussion on integrating Malaysian SMEs into the regional and global supply chains by supporting both MNCs and local companies based in Johor.

The JS-SEZ will also help SMEs tap opportunities arising from the Singapore side, acting as a base for them to access greater logistics and exports enablers to the ASEAN and Asian markets.

Bear in mind, too, of the potential benefits of a successful JS-SEZ for both ordinary Malaysians and Singaporeans.

Traffic congestion and quality of life will improve dramatically once we can create passport-free QR code clearance for everyone at the Malaysia-Singapore border.

All hands-on deck for JS-SEZ

That brings me to the second question: will Malaysia, Singapore and Johor remain committed to the massive undertaking vis-à-vis the JS-SEZ?

The most compelling argument is the unity of purpose and effort between the governments involved—I felt honored and privileged to share the stage with YAB Dato’ Onn Hafiz Ghazi, the Menteri Besar of Johor and H.E. Gan Kim Yong, Singapore’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Trade & Industry, during the Forum.

But even before the Forum, MITI had been busy leading the Working Group for ‘Ease of Doing Business’, while actively supporting others like the Economic Sector (led by the Economic Ministry), Movement of Goods (led by the Royal Malaysian Customs Department) and Talent (led by Ministry of Human Resources).

Agencies like MIDA, IRDA and Invest Johor have been actively collaborating with various local councils in Johor, too.

These have led to some quick wins, including the establishment of the Invest Malaysia Facilitation Centre Johor (IMFC-J) on 18 February 2025, a significant milestone in streamlining investment processes for the JS-SEZ.

JS-SEZ must grow

Therefore, the commitment of all three parties to the JS-SEZ is undoubtedly clear.

In expanding the JS-SEZ scope, for example, the Federal Government supports the Johor state’s proposed regulatory sandbox initiative, which will be instrumental in unlocking new waves of sustainable, high value investments that will benefit both local stakeholders and international partners.

Given the JS-SEZ’s strategic location at the heart of Southeast Asia and Asia, we also aim for the JS-SEZ to support these regional supply chains, which must be championed well beyond Malaysia’s 2025 ASEAN Chairmanship.

This was already exemplified by the MoU exchange at the forum—between Tanjung Langsat Port and Pertamina Energy Terminal—aimed at achieving an annual trading volume of three million tons within JS-SEZ.

This is also why MITI welcomes the Johor Menteri Besar’s proposal to establish an ASEAN (or even RCEP) Industrial Park within the JS-SEZ, to foster economic integration and attract high-value investments from within ASEAN and beyond.

The focus should be on enhancing supply chain efficiency and resilience in Malaysia-Singapore industries that complement, rather than compete, such as R&D, biotechnology, and renewable energy.

There will be skepticism, no doubt, but we must stay the course. Considering how global trade is evolving (potentially for the worse), Malaysia and Singapore must harness their complementary strengths to elevate ourselves regionally vis-à-vis the JS-SEZ.

With the right public-private support from both sides of the Causeway, the JS-SEZ can emerge as a regional economic powerhouse to strengthen both ASEAN and Asia’s supply chain, while serving Asia’s 4.7-billion strong market.

What is clear is that in this quest, both Malaysia and Singapore can be winners via the JS-SEZ.

In a statement, Iskandar also slammed Singapore government’s attempt to link his Islamist party and the opposition Workers’ Party (WP) — calling it “preposterous and counterproductive”.

“I do not believe my Facebook page is influential even in Malaysia and was shocked when it was blocked and cannot be accessed in the republic,” he posted on Facebook.

“Therefore, I am still wondering what the true intention was, but I hope that it was not to link my party to the opposition as such attempt is preposterous and will be counterproductive.”

Iskandar explained he was merely sharing information about notable Muslim candidates from WP, as well as a video of a young Muslim candidate from the rulingPAP introducing himself to voters.

The former Selangor exco explained that his posts were aimed at his predominantly Malay Muslim audience in Malaysia and were not intended to sway voters in Singapore.

“I had never urged the voters to vote along racial and religious lines,” he said, adding that while he expressed hope that some Muslim candidates would win, he did not know them personally and had never met any of them.

Iskandar noted that the only Singaporean politicians he had met were from the PAP, including ministers and MPs, and joked that this could equally be seen as a PAP connection.

“As a politician, I cannot be faulted for having an interest in the political developments of other countries apart from Malaysia,” he said, citing his previous writings on UK politics and his support for the Labour Party during their last general election.

“However, it would be ridiculous to accuse me of interfering with the election process of that country. I have also commented on the politics of other countries as well without any repercussions.”

On Friday, Singapore told Meta to block local access to several Facebook posts by foreigners allegedly attempting to influence the city-state’s upcoming election.

The posts were made by two leaders from the Malaysian Islamist party PAS, and an ex-Singaporean who is now an Australian citizen.

Trade turnover between Turkmenistan and Malaysia reached $131.7 million in 2024, Trend reports.

The announcement was made by Kerimberdi Kurbanov, Minister of Trade and Foreign Economic Relations of Turkmenistan, during the International Forum on Attracting Foreign Investment into Turkmenistan’s Economy, held in Kuala Lumpur.

Kurbanov highlighted that Turkmenistan currently exports agricultural, oil and gas, chemical, and textile products to over 100 countries worldwide. Given the friendly nature of bilateral relations, the minister emphasized the potential for increasing exports of Turkmen textile products to Malaysia. To realize this potential, he stressed the importance of strengthening business-to-business ties between the two nations.

Malaysian enterprises are currently engaged in Turkmenistan, executing initiatives across pivotal sectors such as financial services, hydrocarbon exploration and extraction, and construction engineering methodologies.

EXPERIENCED Malim Gunung (mountain guide) Danson Bulangai, 44, says temperature variations on Mount Kinabalu, Borneo’s highest, have become predictable though seasonal depending on surrounding conditions.

He noticed cooler temperatures are usually felt when a typhoon occurs around the island, the world’s third largest, particularly at altitudes of 1,500 metres and above. Mount Kinabalu, located within Kinabalu Park – Unesco World Heritage Site – 54.2km from Kota Kinabalu, stands at 4,096 metres (13,435 feet).

Danson said although there have been no significant long-term temperature changes, there is speculation of an increase in the acidity of rainfall being due to climate change.

Acid rain is rain or any other form of precipitation that is unusually acidic, meaning it has elevated levels of hydrogen ions (low pH). Most water, including drinking water, has a neutral pH that exists between 6.5 and 8.5, but acid rain has a pH level lower than this and ranges from 4–5 on average.

The more acidic the rain, the lower its pH. Acid rain can have harmful effects on plants, aquatic animals and infrastructure. It is caused by emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, which react with the water molecules in the atmosphere to produce acids.

He said other factors, such as suitability of clothing, also influences how temperatures are perceived by climbers.

“Before 2000, access to appropriate clothing and hiking gear was not as easy as it is today, making both climbers and mountain guides more exposed to the cold.

“Now, even though temperatures can still drop to as low as 3°C at the 11,000ft Panalaban sub-station during windy seasons, the use of more suitable clothing has made temperature changes less noticeable,” said Danson, a licensed guide since 2005.

First as a porter in 1994 before becoming a guide in 1999—Danson climbs Mount Kinabalu an average of 10 times a month, making him a reliable witness to changes in the mountain’s ecosystem.

A mountain guide’s responsibilities go beyond leading and ensuring the safety of climbers. They also act as the eyes and ears for the Kinabalu Park authorities, including helping to enforce Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and relevant enactments to protect the flora, fauna and geological assets along the route to the top and back.

(EPA Images pic)

KAMPALA : Uganda, on Saturday, declared an end to the country’s latest outbreak of Ebola, three months after authorities confirmed cases of the highly infectious and often fatal viral haemorrhagic infection in the capital Kampala.

The East African country announced its latest outbreak on Jan 30 after the death of a male nurse who tested positive for the virus.

“Good news! The current Ebola Sudan virus disease outbreak has officially come to an end,” the health ministry said in a post on the X platform.

It added the declaration of the end of the outbreak followed 42 days “without a new case since the last confirmed patient was discharged.”

In the post, the ministry did not give the latest total caseload recorded during the outbreak.

In early March when the ministry last reported on the caseload, it said at least ten cases had been recorded with two deaths.

Ebola infections are frequent in Uganda which has many tropical forests that are natural reservoirs for the virus.

The latest outbreak, caused by the Sudan strain of the virus which has no approved vaccine, was Uganda’s ninth since the country recorded its first infection in 2000.

Uganda also neighbours the Democratic Republic of Congo which has recorded over a dozen outbreaks, including one in 2018-2020 that killed nearly 2,300 people.

The outbreak started in Kampala, a crowded city of about four million that is also a crossroads for routes branching out to eastern Congo, Kenya, Rwanda and South Sudan.

Although outbreaks have been common, health experts say the country has been able to leverage on its experience battling the disease over the years to bring them under control relatively quickly.

Ebola is transmitted through contact with infected bodily fluids and tissue.

In a press conference, Pas vice-president Datuk Idris Ahmad urged accountability in addressing the environmental and public health concerns raised by the alleged pollution.

""We challenge the Perak state government to present their own laboratory test results, assuming they have conducted a proper investigation. Prove your claims to the public with data, not baseless statements,"" he said.

On April 23, PN revealed the results of their independent investigation into Sungai Bidor’s water quality. Supported by field images, videos and on-site surveys conducted alongside journalists and influencers, they alleged that the pollution stemmed from a nearby pig farm.

""The stench was unbearable. Black water flowed from the farm’s sewage channel and flies swarmed the area. This is the grim reality faced by Ayer Kuning residents who depend on Sungai Bidor,"" Idris said.

PN disclosed that two water samples were taken from Sungai Bidor for testing by an accredited private laboratory.

The results show:

- Sample B1 (upstream of pollution source):

- Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD): < 3 mg/L

- Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD): < 12 mg/L

- Sample B2 (downstream of pollution source):

- BOD: 78 mg/L

- COD: 358 mg/L

""Sample B1 indicates clear water with acceptable quality. However, Sample B2 shows dangerous levels of contamination, clearly linked to waste discharge from the pig farm,"" he said.

While investigations by the Veterinary Department and the Environment Department were reportedly ongoing, Perak Exco member A. Sivanesan has yet to provide conclusive findings.

Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi defended the farm, claiming it complied with all standard operating procedures.

""We openly ask: What methods and evidence did the Deputy Prime Minister rely on to make this conclusion? Did he personally visit the site, or was he relying solely on one-sided reports?,"" Idris said.

Idris also criticised Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Saarani Mohamad for failing to address key issues of environmental pollution and public health.

""His comments on using polluted water for ablution miss the larger point: the safety of Sungai Bidor’s water and the health of its surrounding communities.

O’Reilly's recent remarks made on TikTok stated that Malaysia’s household income per capita stands at USD5,731 (RM25,061) per year, while the US records USD42,220 (RM184,628).

""That figure makes it an eightfold difference.

""Malaysia is angry with me, this is a ridiculous story,"" he said.

Previously, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim had slammed O’Reilly’s remarks in which he claimed that Southeast Asia has ‘no money,’ describing the statement as arrogant and ignorant.

Anwar, who also serves as the Finance Minister, said the statement not only demonstrated O’Reilly’s ignorance of Southeast Asia’s current reality but also reflected a narrow mindset shaped by racism and colonial ideology.

Kota Kinabalu:

Warisan Kota Kinabalu secretary Loi Kok Liang has urged the State Government to reassess its raw log export policy, following the interception of a timber shipment at Tawau Port that was confirmed to originate from a legal concession under Yayasan Sabah.

Although the shipment was deemed legal by the Sabah Forestry Department, Loi questioned the rationale behind such exports, stating that “legal does not mean reasonable.”

In a statement issued, Loi expressed concern over what he described as a noticeable increase in logging activities across the state this year.

He warned that deforestation is contributing to more frequent and severe flooding, with long-term environmental impacts far outweighing any immediate economic gains.

“The destruction of water catchment areas is particularly alarming,” he said. “Without trees to absorb rainwater, runoff increases, resulting in soil erosion and floods that affect communities.”

Loi also criticised the current economic model that prioritises raw log exports over local industry development. He argued that retaining logs for domestic use—such as in furniture manufacturing and woodcraft—could generate significant employment opportunities for Sabahans.

“Thousands of jobs could be created if logs were processed locally instead of being shipped overseas,” he said.

Highlighting issues of governance, Loi raised concerns over the lack of transparency in logging concessions, warning that Sabah’s forest reserves risk depletion if current practices persist.

“We must stop being slaves to raw material exports,” he said. “Sabah’s forests should serve the people, not be exploited by politically connected business interests.”

He called on the State Government to prioritise sustainability and environmental stewardship in its forestry policies.

Fadillah, who is also the Minister of Energy Transition and Water Transformation, said that TNB’s investment through Vantage RE Ltd (Vantage RE) in the Blyth Offshore Demonstrator Ltd (BODL) offshore wind farm in Newcastle, United Kingdom (UK), demonstrates the ability of large Malaysian companies to invest and expand internationally.

“Congratulations to TNB for exploring and expanding their reach internationally, especially in the UK, which includes Ireland, Scotland, and so forth.”

“This shows the capability of Malaysian companies, which not only benefits TNB itself but also our country in terms of foreign investment,” he told reporters after visiting the Blyth Offshore Wind Farm on Saturday.

Also present were TNB’s new energy officer, Mohd Zarihi Mohd Hashim, and Sarawak Energy Bhd group chief executive officer, Datuk Sharbini Suhaili.

Fadillah hopes that more large companies, particularly government-linked companies and government-linked investment companies, will recognise the potential for investment abroad.

The 41.5-megawatt (MW) offshore wind farm, which began operations in 2017, is located approximately 6.5 kilometres from the coastline.

Vantage RE holds a 49 per cent stake in BODL, the owner of the wind farm.

Vantage RE also manages and develops TNB’s renewable energy asset portfolio, totalling 1.3 gigawatts in the UK and Ireland.

Recently, Vantage RE also constructed a 100 MW solar farm in the UK, which will be equipped with a battery energy storage system in the future, further positioning TNB as a leader and catalyst in the renewable energy industry in Malaysia.

Regarding Malaysia’s participation in the two-day Summit on the Future of Energy Security held in Lancaster House, London, which concluded on Friday, Fadillah said it was an excellent opportunity for Malaysia to learn about the latest energy technologies.

“This is the best opportunity for our country, not only to learn but also to expand and share experiences with other countries. So, I believe this is a chance for our companies to broaden their horizons,” he said.

Fadillah added that the summit also provided Malaysia with a platform to express its commitment to environmental stewardship and to strengthen collaborations in technology and expertise.

The summit was organised by the International Energy Agency and the UK government, bringing together global decision-makers to plan and shape actions toward the future of energy security. — Bernama",1.74578E+12,en,0.85840869,2025-04-27 03:08:35,"['per', 'deputy', 'minister', 'newcastle', 'continuously', 'express', 'suhaili', 'particularly', 'visiting', 'provided', 'saturday', 'tenaga', 'present', 'hashim', 'develop', 'seri', 'yusof', 'security', 'mohd', 'cent', 'capability', 'officer', 'energy', 'collaboration', 'friday', 'enhance', 'bodl', 'plan', 'owner', 'governmentlinked', 'investment', 'constructed', 'expertise', 'invest', 'coastline', 'totalling', 'farm', 'concluded', 'transformation', 'term', 'leader', 'added', 'hope', 'held', 'forth', 'malaysian', 'horizon', 'scotland', 'began', 'together', 'participation', 'located', 'catalyst', 'international', 'excellent', 'opportunity', 'show', 'also', 'transition', 'learn', 'stake', 'equipped', 'overseas', 'recently', 'regarding', 'shape', 'bringing', 'vantage', 'especially', 'experience', 'united', 'gigawatts', 'group', 'internationally', 'potential', 'asset', 'renewable', 'benefit', 'latest', 'fadillah', 'commitment', 'wind', 'datuk', 'sarawak', 'blyth', 'expanding', 'believe', 'hold', 'kingdom', 'technology', 'chance', 'lancaster', 'platform', 'ireland', 'future', 'twoday', 'organised', 'congratulation', 'agency', 'reporter', 'battery', 'water', 'house', 'environmental', 'bhd', 'global', 'bernama', 'nasional', 'exploring', 'kilometre', 'sharbini', 'abroad', 'country', 'london', 'action', 'positioning', 'strengthen', 'ability', 'megawatt', 'ltd', 'toward', 'best', 'executive', 'approximately', 'company', 'portfolio', 'large', 'expand', 'develops', 'decisionmakers', 'share', 'summit', 'system', 'manages', 'government', 'zarihi', 'stewardship', 'operation', 'foreign', 'demonstrator', 'tnbs', 'includes', 'reach', 'chief', 'storage', 'shown', 'april', 'industry', 'broaden', 'malaysia', 'offshore', 'said', 'prime', 'tnb', 'recognise', 'new', 'solar', 'demonstrates', 'told']",Positive

This is done to anticipate the impact of the United States' import tariffs.

""Indonesia has recently joined BRICS, providing access to new markets, and Indonesia's accession to CPTPP,"" said Airlangga in a virtual press conference on Friday, April 25, 2025. According to him, Indonesia's membership in BRICS and the process of accession to CPTPP will open new markets such as the UK, Mexico, and some countries in Latin America.

Indonesia has been a member of BRICS since January 6, 2025. BRICS was established to challenge the world order dominated by the United States and its Western allies. Meanwhile, CPTPP consists of 11 countries, namely Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam. Indonesia is currently in the process of proposing accession to join this economic agreement.

In addition to CPTPP, Airlangga mentioned Indonesia's target to finalize cooperation in the Indonesia-European Union Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (IEU-CEPA).

""We have communicated with the commissioners in IEU-CEPA, and they are currently very open and eager to have this CEPA finalized,"" he said. Airlangga stated that Indonesia will prioritize bilateral and multilateral cooperation to open new markets.

On the same occasion, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati revealed that the 10 percent import tariffs imposed by the United States have decreased cross-border shipments. Sri Mulyani stated that the Finance Ministry has analyzed to identify commodities with a Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) above one, making them competitive for trade.

""We will convey this to Pak Menko so we can discuss together what can be done to encourage national industries with a strong Comparative Advantage. So they can penetrate not only the American market but also other markets,"" said Sri Mulyani.

State Housing, Local Government, Drainage, Climate Change and Disaster Management Committee chairman Datuk Rais Yasin said all state-level matters, including land issues and coordination with local authorities, have already been resolved.

However, he added, the project remains delayed at the federal level due to pending decisions on budget allocation and tender processes.

“We’re still waiting for a clear sign from KPKT, such as a ground-breaking date. I will continue pushing to get this project moving,” he told reporters at the Sungai Udang constituency’s Hari Raya open house today.

Rais said the WTE plant, located at the Sungai Udang Sanitary Solid Waste Landfill, was expected to begin construction by June 2024 and reach completion by 2028, as previously stated by KPKT.

On Friday, Melaka Governor Tun Mohd Ali Rustam urged both the state and federal governments to act swiftly, warning that further delays could exacerbate conditions at the landfill and heighten public concern.

In addition to the WTE project, Rais said a new landfill cell is being planned at the site to support future solid waste management needs.

The project has received federal funding and is currently undergoing an environmental impact assessment (EIA), he added.

The Sungai Udang state assembly coordinator also stated that the state plans to develop a dedicated disposal site at the same location for construction, commercial, industrial, and institutional (CCI) waste.

“These initiatives aim to extend the lifespan of Melaka’s sole solid waste facility,” he noted.

The representatives of international organisations, state management authorities, and the business community looked at the crucial role of digital technology application in developing agriculture.

“The green revolution is not just about innovation. It’s about empowering people, protecting the planet, and ensuring no-one is left behind. Precision agriculture and digital platforms enable farmers to produce more with fewer resources, optimising yields, minimising wastewater, and focusing on the best use of limited resources,” said Donal Brown, associate vice-president at the International Fund for Agricultural Development.

For example, biotechnology supports in growing crops for a more resilient climate, ensuring food security. In a new era of unpredictable weather patterns, smart water and soil management systems contribute to reducing waste and simultaneously ensure the ecosystems, paving the way for sustainable farming practices.

“Besides that, climate-smart farming methods that boost resilience while cutting emissions are considered essential, with examples like improved wet and dry techniques for rice farming,” added Brown.

In Vietnam, the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment is gradually implementing the transformation of agriculture towards green, smart, and sustainable practices.

To realise these targets, the government has issued several key strategies and national plans that cover the rest of this decade. In addition, players such as Tan Long Group, Vinamilk, VinEco, TH Group, and HAGL Agrico have pioneered the adoption of high technology in agricultural production.

Digital technologies are helping Tan Long Group improve operational efficiency, reduce costs, and optimise resource utilisation, according to CEO Truong Sy Ba at the P4G event.

“For example, the company is exploring AI and machine learning applications to analyse data from various sources such as cameras and sensors to assess animal health, stress, and welfare. This can help in early disease detection and optimising feeding and environmental conditions,” Ba said.

“The group uses technologies like GPS and soil sensors to optimise farming practices, ensuring efficient resource allocation and maximising crop yields. Digital technology is being used to monitor production processes, implement quality control measures, and ensure the high quality of finished products,” Ba added.

In the process of establishing sustainable and low-emission agriculture, Vietnam also receives the support of other countries and international organisations.

“We see a strong alignment between Ireland and Vietnam in the vision of our approach, and significant potential for partnerships that can help to drive transformation. One area of our cooperation has been in monitoring and evaluation, which is essential to guide evidence-based work,” said Deirdre Ní Fhallúin, Ambassador of Ireland to Vietnam.

Last year, Ireland worked with the former Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to roll out a monitoring and evaluation framework for food system transformation in Vietnam. The project focused on using AI to help farmers achieve higher yields by preserving soil and saving water in the context of environmental and climate pressures.

Another venture from the Irish focuses on transforming waste from the coffee industry into sustainable micro proteins.

Research and innovation in smart agriculture have made notable progress around Vietnam, but challenges remain. Most smallholder farmers and small enterprises face difficulties in accessing advanced technology due to constraints in capital and technical infrastructure.

“We recognise that innovation, with a focus on research and the application of modern science and technology, is the core to achieving gains in the agricultural sector. We also understand that no country can achieve success in transforming its food system alone.

This day transcends a mere public holiday; it’s an opportunity to acknowledge the dignity inherent in all labor, champion workers’ rights, and reaffirm our commitment to a just and equitable society.

Across Malaysia, from bustling urban centers to the serene landscapes of Sabah, Labour Day unites us in recognizing the invaluable contributions of every worker.

Rooted in the 19th-century global fight for fair working conditions, Labour Day was officially recognized in Malaysia in 1972. However, the struggle for workers’ rights in our nation stretches back further, to the arduous conditions faced by laborers under British colonial rule. The seeds of organized advocacy were sown by early trade unions, paving the way for crucial post-independence reforms.

Sabah’s Labour Day narrative is interwoven with its unique history, shaped by its rich natural resources.

Indigenous communities played a vital role in early industries like timber and agriculture, often facing marginalization despite their essential contributions. While integration into Malaysia’s labor framework brought advancements, disparities between urban and rural workers persist.

Malaysia’s remarkable transformation into a diverse, modern economy is a direct result of the hard work of its people. From the rubber estates of Kedah to Kuala Lumpur’s iconic skyline and Sabah’s palm oil plantations, laborers have been the engine of our growth. The thriving manufacturing sector and the expansive services sector, contributing significantly to our GDP, both rely on the dedication of countless workers.

The logistics industry stands as a crucial example of this interdependence. Malaysia’s strategic position as a trade hub means its ports and transportation networks depend on the tireless efforts of dockworkers, drivers and warehouse staff. The surge in e-commerce has further highlighted the indispensable role of delivery riders and logistics personnel.

In Sabah, logistics workers navigate unique challenges posed by its diverse terrain and infrastructure, connecting rural communities and sustaining vital supply chains. Their work is crucial to the prosperity of both the state and the nation.

Despite these achievements, Malaysian workers continue to face significant inequalities. The Covid-19 pandemic starkly revealed vulnerabilities, particularly for daily wage earners. In Sabah, rural workers faced disproportionate hardship. Stagnant wages struggle to keep pace with rising living costs, and the minimum wage remains a point of contention, especially in urban centers like Kota Kinabalu.

Logistics workers often endure long hours and hazardous conditions. Gig economy workers, including many delivery riders, lack essential social safety nets. In Sabah, infrastructure challenges further complicate their work. Automation also presents a potential threat to job security in this sector.

Gender disparities persist across Malaysia, and in Sabah, cultural factors and limited childcare options further impact women’s participation in the workforce. Migrant workers in Sabah’s key sectors are often vulnerable to exploitation, while marginalized communities like the stateless Bajau Laut face severe barriers to legal employment.

Addressing these issues requires collaborative action. Government reforms are underway, and NGOs in Sabah actively advocate for workers’ rights.

The National Logistics Policy aims to modernize the sector, potentially improving working conditions.

Investments in Sabah’s infrastructure and the digitalization of processes also offer hope. Unions and worker collectives are vital in advocating for fair treatment.

This Labour Day, let us move beyond celebration to meaningful action. For Sabah, this means bridging divides, investing in skills development, and protecting vulnerable workers. For the logistics sector, it means prioritizing worker welfare alongside technological advancement.

Labour Day serves as a reflection of our national values. As Malaysia progresses, our growth must be rooted in justice and inclusivity, ensuring that every worker, from every corner of our nation, is valued and empowered. Let us renew our commitment to a Malaysia where the dignity of labor is paramount. The journey for workers’ rights continues, and on this Labour Day, we celebrate our progress while resolutely striving for a more equitable future for all.",1.74569E+12,en,0.322794437,2025-04-26 09:24:06,"['rule', 'beyond', 'marginalization', 'meaningful', 'staff', 'direct', 'celebrate', 'brought', 'net', 'sector', 'supply', 'across', 'early', 'protecting', 'work', 'rich', 'valued', 'including', 'advocate', 'policy', 'honor', 'particularly', 'mere', 'disproportionate', 'struggle', 'interwoven', 'champion', 'way', 'contention', 'modernize', 'hard', 'earner', 'achievement', 'timber', 'prosperity', 'continue', 'employment', 'ensuring', 'foundation', 'tireless', 'rubber', 'urban', 'stand', 'interdependence', 'present', 'condition', 'crucial', 'trade', 'security', 'childcare', 'collective', 'move', 'unique', 'center', 'reaffirm', 'disparity', 'social', 'exploitation', 'agriculture', 'holiday', 'celebration', 'driver', 'fight', 'chain', 'minimum', 'face', 'diverse', 'covid', 'worker', 'severe', 'stretch', 'arduous', 'vital', 'logistics', 'facing', 'paving', 'complicate', 'limited', 'investment', 'thriving', 'option', 'daily', 'infrastructure', 'often', 'oil', 'lumpurs', 'moment', 'transformation', 'must', 'requires', 'value', 'network', 'essential', 'may', 'hope', 'connecting', 'inclusivity', 'investing', 'malaysian', 'dockworker', 'significantly', 'participation', 'depend', 'kota', 'vulnerable', 'progress', 'opportunity', 'persist', 'rely', 'port', 'estate', 'living', 'cultural', 'laut', 'union', 'also', 'striving', 'pace', 'kinabalu', 'played', 'unites', 'expansive', 'key', 'continues', 'workforce', 'surge', 'posed', 'remains', 'terrain', 'labor', 'mean', 'especially', 'barrier', 'working', 'plantation', 'highlighted', 'transportation', 'laborer', 'potential', 'sustaining', 'state', 'factor', 'rising', 'labour', 'commitment', 'faced', 'long', 'warehouse', 'personnel', 'significant', 'revealed', 'impact', 'empowered', 'renew', 'threat', 'wage', 'underway', 'issue', 'delivery', 'invaluable', 'framework', 'society', 'challenge', 'improving', 'safety', 'position', 'journey', 'role', 'hub', 'automation', 'mark', 'fair', 'skyline', 'natural', 'remarkable', 'reform', 'kedah', 'resolutely', 'addressing', 'however', 'future', 'hardship', 'womens', 'point', 'bridging', 'navigate', 'landscape', 'serf', 'indigenous', 'gdp', 'development', 'prioritizing', 'nation', 'effort', 'indispensable', 'advocacy', 'cost', 'actively', 'inherent', 'keep', 'rooted', 'job', 'countless', 'result', 'global', 'manufacturing', 'service', 'legal', 'starkly', 'stagnant', 'alongside', 'narrative', 'dedication', 'action', 'colonial', 'equitable', 'rider', 'thcentury', 'example', 'seed', 'divide', 'integration', 'offer', 'corner', 'every', 'modern', 'people', 'despite', 'gender', 'justice', 'iconic', 'ngo', 'potentially', 'national', 'approach', 'growth', 'stateless', 'welfare', 'shaped', 'community', 'vulnerability', 'serene', 'right', 'migrant', 'collaborative', 'bustling', 'let', 'contributing', 'public', 'aim', 'advocating', 'kuala', 'lack', 'government', 'economy', 'hazardous', 'hour', 'endure', 'transcends', 'postindependence', 'ecommerce', 'organized', 'recognizing', 'bajau', 'day', 'sown', 'inequality', 'marginalized', 'digitalization', 'technological', 'paramount', 'strategic', 'skill', 'sabah', 'reflection', 'advancement', 'engine', 'officially', 'back', 'history', 'industry', 'malaysia', 'rural', 'palm', 'many', 'treatment', 'true', 'dignity', 'contribution', 'pandemic', 'acknowledge', 'british', 'process', 'resource', 'recognized', 'gig', 'like']",Neutral

export,STIA calls for a total ban on the export of logs,1.74562E+12,Daily Express Malaysia,www.dailyexpress.com.my,https://news.google.com/read/CBMiZEFVX3lxTE9qTnhDbXNOQlJlX045ZVo2TjdxME5aS2VYVkFLVXFvWWdsM1dZWUR1dzVjX2JIZUJ6YnN4N1FocFA1QTJvRDVteUx5cU9VOTluSmREQ1lUSF96U05La1Yxdy1aVXU?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=101124,"STIA calls for a total ban on the export of logs

Kota Kinabalu:

The Sabah Timber Industries Association (STIA) has urged the State Government to consider a total ban on the export of logs derived from natural forest to ensure all timber resources are fully-utilised by the local industry. STIA President Datuk James Hwong (pic) said there was enough local processing capacity to fully utilise the export grade logs and the industry was able to pay for the export grade logs like any foreign buyer.

He said the local industry also preferred Sabah logs in terms of costing as there was a significant saving in shipping, transport and handling cost compared to using imported logs.

The logs in Sabah go direct to the local processing mills and can ensure production of better value-added finished products due to the freshness of local logs, he said. In this respect, STIA called on the government to provide forest production land to the industry for tree plantation purpose.

""Tree plantation land should be offered to the industry players as they know best what are the suitable species to be planted for the markets,"" he said, adding that the government should not over emphasise on collection of revenue from timber but should look at other contribution from the wood- based industry such as provision of employment for local people as well as sustainable usage of raw material.

STIA called upon the Ministry of Industrial Development to assist the industry in developing technology transformation and financial support in terms of tariff and tax rebate as well as financial backup.

At this juncture, the Association would be seeking an appointment with the Chief Minister to further discuss the proposal to ban log exports.

This was among the proposals adopted during the STIA's 28th Annual Delegates Conference (ADC) on June 26 here for the government to ensure the continuous existence of the wood-based sector in Sabah.

The delegates unanimously agreed that the Association must highlight issues publicly to alert the State Government of the difficult situation the industry has been facing for so many years.

""The problems persist until today. It is the Association's hope that the State and Federal Government will look into the problems faced by the timber industry,"" he said. According to him, shortage of raw material has been the biggest single issue affecting the timber industry.

Log production from natural and plantation forest has not been able to fill in the shortage.

Last year, the log production from natural forest was recorded at 1.565 million cubic metres while 1.093 million cubic metres were recorded for plantation logs.

To ease the shortfalls, local manufacturers have been importing raw material from outside the country but the volume of import was very limited due to the high cost involved.

Hwong said the STIA was working closely with the State Government, particularly the State Forestry Department to resolve technical issues as a result of demand for legal and certified timber globally.

""The Association is promoting high quality timber being produced in Sabah and ensures efforts undertaken by the State Government to maintain the best forest sustainability policy are reciprocated by the industry by promoting exports of legal and Timber Legality Assurance System (TLAS) compliance products.

""Capacity building initiatives are also being undertaken jointly to train the industry players in adhering to global technical requirements for wood products,"" he said.

Hwong said the STIA also hoped for an update on the establishment of the Sabah Logistic Council which had been announced by Deputy Chief Minister Tan Sri Joseph Pairin Kitingan in October last year.

The special committee was reportedly to regulate charges imposed by shipping companies transporting goods between ports from Semenanjung Malaysia and Sabah and Sarawak.

""STIA urges the relevant ministry and agencies to initiate the first step to facilitate and voice out Sabahans' concern on this matter,"" he said.

Hwong assured that STIA will continue to play an active role in the development of the timber industry in Sabah and hoped the government can provide the necessary support and back-up plan for the industry to move forward during this difficult period.",1.7457E+12,en,-0.085947484,2025-04-25 21:40:32,"['minister', 'biggest', 'deputy', 'direct', 'sector', 'sustainability', 'usage', 'high', 'buyer', 'forestry', 'policy', 'particularly', 'period', 'respect', 'involved', 'appointment', 'import', 'ease', 'timber', 'export', 'hwong', 'employment', 'continue', 'finished', 'market', 'move', 'step', 'single', 'transporting', 'forward', 'valueadded', 'facilitate', 'train', 'preferred', 'closely', 'conference', 'globally', 'matter', 'continuous', 'log', 'june', 'plan', 'limited', 'mill', 'look', 'material', 'facing', 'last', 'fully', 'year', 'term', 'transformation', 'annual', 'must', 'upon', 'metre', 'consider', 'ensures', 'difficult', 'hope', 'council', 'pairin', 'tan', 'proposal', 'voice', 'advertisement', 'committee', 'kota', 'cubic', 'specie', 'port', 'pay', 'persist', 'also', 'based', 'wood', 'good', 'kinabalu', 'call', 'production', 'outside', 'undertaken', 'special', 'adhering', 'planted', 'kitingan', 'shipping', 'plantation', 'working', 'seeking', 'costing', 'resolve', 'today', 'relevant', 'delegate', 'state', 'ministry', 'shortfall', 'association', 'know', 'player', 'juncture', 'faced', 'assured', 'significant', 'datuk', 'produced', 'sarawak', 'called', 'announced', 'revenue', 'issue', 'adc', 'backup', 'offered', 'technology', 'publicly', 'maintain', 'well', 'highlight', 'volume', 'assurance', 'grade', 'sponsored', 'role', 'utilise', 'regulate', 'sabahan', 'semenanjung', 'natural', 'provide', 'requirement', 'unanimously', 'situation', 'derived', 'raw', 'product', 'purpose', 'agreed', 'play', 'among', 'tariff', 'agency', 'urge', 'rebate', 'federal', 'fullyutilised', 'financial', 'saving', 'suitable', 'development', 'support', 'fill', 'effort', 'charge', 'necessary', 'existence', 'demand', 'enough', 'cost', 'stias', 'million', 'reciprocated', 'result', 'global', 'building', 'tax', 'affecting', 'adding', 'manufacturer', 'legal', 'first', 'stia', 'joseph', 'country', 'technical', 'pic', 'ensure', 'active', 'capacity', 'able', 'people', 'best', 'company', 'jointly', 'imported', 'tree', 'would', 'certified', 'total', 'according', 'compared', 'provision', 'concern', 'woodbased', 'system', 'october', 'tlas', 'imposed', 'government', 'industrial', 'recorded', 'compliance', 'shortage', 'content', 'initiate', 'update', 'foreign', 'importing', 'processing', 'assist', 'logistic', 'forest', 'local', 'collection', 'problem', 'sabah', 'alert', 'initiative', 'sri', 'chief', 'adopted', 'legality', 'due', 'establishment', 'industry', 'ban', 'land', 'department', 'reportedly', 'president', 'said', 'many', 'contribution', 'malaysia', 'handling', 'hoped', 'developing', 'discus', 'urged', 'sustainable', 'using', 'quality', 'james', 'resource', 'emphasise', 'better', 'transport', 'like', 'promoting', 'freshness']",Neutral

MYANMAR:

A charred hillside is wreathed by flames, spewing ochre smoke that smothers out sunlight in an apocalyptic scene.

But the villagers who set it ablaze dance below in a ceremony celebrating the inferno as a moment of regeneration and hope.

“It’s a tradition from our ancestors,” said Joseph, a youth leader from Tha Yu village in Myanmar’s eastern Shan state.

“It’s the only way we survive,” added Joseph, who goes by only one name.

Every year between January and April, South-East Asia is plagued by smog from farmers lighting fires to clear land, emitting microscopic PM 2.5 pollution that lines the lungs and enters the bloodstream.

Myanmar residents lose 2.3 years of life expectancy as a result of pollution from farming fires and other sources, according to analysis of 2022 data by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.

Since a 2021 coup, the country has been riven by a civil war between the military and a patchwork of anti-coup partisans and ethnic minority armed groups, leaving the toll from pollution largely ignored.

But in Tha Yu village, there are additional tensions – between the old ways of agriculture and new knowledge about environmental risks.

“We don’t have any other work or opportunities in our region,” said Joseph, 27, as haze swallowed the hills behind him, scorched to make way for paddy rice, chilli and corn. “So, we are forced into this tradition every year.”

Most agricultural burn-off happens when farmers incinerate the stubble of old harvests in their fields to make room for the new, and to fertilise the soil.

But the smoke billowing around Tha Yu village is from “slash and burn” agriculture – a method also called shifting cultivation, in which patches of wild vegetation are burnt for similar purposes, with crops planted for only a few growing cycles.

“If possible, we want to try other agricultural methods but we don’t have any technology and no one has taught us,” said Joseph.

Environmentalists generally say slash and burn farming can be twice as harmful because it lays waste to tracts of existing plant life which would otherwise absorb carbon dioxide emissions.",1.74576E+12,en,-0.581688643,2025-04-27 01:22:50,"['sunlight', 'village', 'knowledge', 'ancestor', 'carbon', 'scorched', 'work', 'billowing', 'flame', 'resident', 'eastern', 'policy', 'military', 'hill', 'analysis', 'southeast', 'dioxide', 'way', 'say', 'hillside', 'cultivation', 'slash', 'around', 'civil', 'survive', 'harvest', 'try', 'environmentalist', 'existing', 'dont', 'ablaze', 'agriculture', 'taught', 'tha', 'energy', 'tract', 'enters', 'swallowed', 'waste', 'tradition', 'chilli', 'plant', 'source', 'january', 'ochre', 'year', 'lung', 'toll', 'moment', 'myanmar', 'leader', 'scene', 'lose', 'added', 'hope', 'absorb', 'microscopic', 'asia', 'advertisement', 'lighting', 'university', 'leaving', 'charred', 'opportunity', 'rice', 'patchwork', 'emitting', 'paddy', 'additional', 'since', 'also', 'generally', 'farming', 'patch', 'forced', 'shifting', 'ceremony', 'partisan', 'burnt', 'celebrating', 'planted', 'corn', 'vegetation', 'similar', 'one', 'group', 'room', 'old', 'state', 'institute', 'possible', 'wreathed', 'set', 'called', 'expectancy', 'clear', 'smoke', 'otherwise', 'make', 'smother', 'technology', 'haze', 'farmer', 'sponsored', 'dance', 'coup', 'youth', 'plagued', 'life', 'name', 'tension', 'anticoup', 'smog', 'purpose', 'region', 'emission', 'environmental', 'result', 'bloodstream', 'wild', 'burn', 'harmful', 'joseph', 'country', 'war', 'crop', 'riven', 'stokes', 'fertilise', 'method', 'every', 'agricultural', 'happens', 'minority', 'stubble', 'field', 'fire', 'incinerate', 'would', 'soil', 'according', 'inferno', 'want', 'spewing', 'behind', 'content', 'growing', 'apocalyptic', 'largely', 'cycle', 'burnoff', 'lay', 'regeneration', 'line', 'data', 'april', 'villager', 'land', 'said', 'pollution', 'ignored', 'festival', 'risk', 'armed', 'new', 'ethnic', 'chicago', 'twice']",Negative

Kota Kinabalu:

Chief Minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor commended the Kibing Group’s commitment to providing employment opportunities to 700 more Sabahans through its latest recruitment drive beginning in May.

He said the new intake would add to the 1,625 Sabahans already working in various management, engineering, technical and operations positions, making it 2,325 in all.

“This constituted more than 83 per cent of the Kibing Group’s total workforce. A positive development indeed as this not only empowers local communities but also fosters a sense of shared prosperity. Congratulations and thank you,” he said at the Aidilfitri reception with Kibing personnel at its plant in the Kota Kinabalu Industrial Park (KKIP), Friday.

Earlier, Hajiji was briefed that Kibing Group would embark on its recruitment drive in collaboration with the SMJ Secretariat from May 13 to May 23 at the district offices of Ranau, Tuaran, Beaufort, Papar, Kota Kinabalu and Penampang.

“I must also stress the importance of prioritising the employment of Sabahans and call upon all industry players to not only employ Sabahans but also invest in their training and development.

“This collective effort is essential to ensure they possesses the necessary skills and knowledge to meet demands of the industry,” he said.

Hajiji said it was a momentous occasion when the Kibing Group commenced construction of its RM2.5 billion cutting-edge solar glass manufacturing plant in Sabah in 2022.

“Today, the Kibing Group’s presence is not only a transformative venture for Sabah but a testament to the State Government’s success in pursuing high-impact projects for the state’s progress and economic growth,” he said.

He also said Kibing Group has since made great strides when, last November, the Group invested in another venture to build a new RM7.2 billion solar glass plant in Kimanis.

“To date, the positive ripple effect of the Kibing Group’s presence in Sabah is already evident and encouraging, with over RM50 million in contract value awarded to local companies since construction began.

“We hold a deep sense of optimism that the Kibing Group will continue to thrive and play an instrumental role in contributing to Sabah’s long-term prosperity,” he said.

During the briefing, Hajiji was also told that Kibing’s first line is running full production, exporting 1,500 containers valued at USD14 million per month.

Kibing’s second line is expected to reach full production in June, while its third line is expected to reach full production by year end. Kibing export destinations are Southeast Asia, South Asia, North America, Africa and Europe.

“I wish to emphasise the State Government’s commitment to facilitate investments into Sabah. We are resolute in our mission to create an environment that attracts more investors. These investments are also about creating employment, fostering innovation and improving the lives of our people,” he said.

This year commemorates the 80th year of the end of World War II in 1945.

The Japanese invaded Borneo on Dec 16, 1941 by landing a force at Miri in Sarawak. On Jan 3, 1942, Japanese forces entered Sabah via Labuan and 16 days later, they arrived at Sandakan.

The people of Sabah endured three and a half years of Japanese occupation. The first group of Prisoners of War arrived at Sandakan in July 1942, and more came in April 1943.

“We heard or read about how the local people were shocked by the cruel treatment the men suffered. We remember with pride that some local people took risks to offer help to the men by smuggling food, medicines, and messages into the prison camp,” he said.

Only six prisoners of war survived the ordeal. They showed tremendous courage risking their lives to escape from the death marches and from Ranau in desperate attempts to stay alive.

Others who escaped, died in the jungles or in shelters the local people provided them.

Many more starved and many sick men died or were murdered at Sandakan, on the death marches and at Ranau.

“Each man who survived owed his life to the brave local people who sheltered and cared for them until they could be rescued,” he said.

The survivors provided a record of the atrocities committed against the Prisoners of War and many had the courage to testify against their tormenters in war crimes trials after the war.

Many of the Prisoners of War who suffered here now rest in peace in the soil of Sabah and within the Labuan War Cemetery.

“Here, at the Sandakan Memorial Park, we remember the suffering, courage and endurance of all the Australian and British prisoners of war,” said.

“This memorial is a partnership between our peoples to ensure they are never forgotten,” he added.

On Anzac Day, we honour the service and sacrifice of the men who were prisoners of war here.

The humanity shown to them by the local people was a ray of light in their unimaginably terrible time.

The legacy of those who lived and died during that terrible time is the lasting bond between our peoples.

“Together, we will ensure they are not forgotten.” He added.

Meanwhile, Danielle said, it is also an honor for them to be in Sandakan for the Anzac Day where in Australia, it also marks as their national holiday and few students also come here as well as the POW family members and friends.

“Off course we also will encourage our peoples to came here and visits Sandakan,” she said.

She also thank Sandakan Municipal Council, Sabah Forestry and Sabah Tourism Board and related agencies which involved at the commemoration every year in Sandakan.

While one of local Sabah, late Lagan Arnesto son, Alban Joseph Lagan, who also came at the event said, it is also great honor to here, where his father also one of Sabahan who help the POW and he died in Khucing, Sarawak during the war time.

Sharing his experience, he said, during the war, he only 7, and always saw the POW marching in front of their house in St.Mary, Sandakan and will never forgotten the history.

Meanwhile, Frankie said, he had the honour of attending the Anzac Day 2025 Dawn Service held at the Sandakan Memorial Park – a solemn ceremony that pays tribute to the soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice during World War II, especially the POW.

He added, Anzac Day serves as a powerful reminder of the price of peace and the depth of human resilience.

“We are reminded of the suffering endured by thousands of Allied soldiers, particularly the Australian and British POWs, during their internment in Sandakan.” He said.

Their bravery and endurance continue to inspire future generations to uphold the values of courage, unity, and humanity.

“Sabah and Sandakan in particular, hold a special place in this shared history, and we remain committed to preserving that legacy through respect, education, and continued bilateral engagement.” He stressed.

At the same program, after the dawn service, Vivian and Danielle officiate the Sandakan Memorial Park Interpretive Pavillion which re-dedicated April, 25 in rememberance of all those who suffered and died here, on the death marches, and at Ranau, also with ongoing gratitude to the local people who risked their lives to assist them.

The original Sandakan Interpretive Pavilion was built in 1999, predominantly of hardwood timber.

Due to the harsh tropical climate in Sandakan, the original pavilion was demolished in 2023 as it had reached the end of its usable life. The photo below shows the front of the original pavilion. The original dedication plaques were retained and are to the left of this panel.

The Sandakan Interpretive Pavilion was constructed in 2024 from termite and weather-resistant materials.

In an effort to preserve the heritage of the original pavilion, some features of the original pavilion were incorporated into the refurbished pavilion, including the timber cladding used on this wall, the wooden seats (inside and outside the pavilion), the decorative gates to the left of the main entrance, and the stained-glass window.

Vivian thank the Australian government for giving the fund to renovate the pavilion which will give a memory to all especially the POW friends and family who came here.

Singapore’s political leaders are warning against foreign attempts to influence voters in an election campaign, under measures introduced four years ago to guard against external meddling.

Lawrence Wong, leader of the city-state’s ruling People’s Action Party, said at a rally on Saturday that foreign actors, including a political party in Malaysia, had tried to influence the outcome of Singapore’s elections. He warned that the mixing of religion and politics, as well as calls to support candidates based on race or religion, were “very dangerous”.

Pritam Singh, who leads the largest opposition Workers’ Party, said his team categorically rejects any involvement of foreign elements in domestic politics. “Singapore is our business — nobody else’s,” Singh said at a rally the same day.

The warnings followed a government order issued to Meta Platforms Inc to take down several Facebook advertisements published by foreigners during the election period, according to a statement from the Ministry of Home Affairs and Elections Department on Friday.

This is the first parliamentary election since the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act was passed in 2021, which gives officials power to curb foreign efforts to influence Singapore’s political affairs.

Authorities identified two members of Parti Islam Se-Malaysia — a conservative Islamist party and the largest opposition group in Malaysia — among the Facebook posts. The list also included an Australian citizen who renounced his Singapore citizenship in 2020 and had previously been detained under Singapore’s Internal Security Act for promotion of the terrorist group ISIS, according to the statement.

Paul Tambyah, chairman of opposition Singapore Democratic Party, raised concerns about foreign bots on Facebook spreading misinformation about candidates. Tambyah urged the Ministry of Digital Development and Information to take action, stressing that the impact of such influences may persist beyond elections.

PETALING JAYA : The Selangor government has disbursed three months’ worth of rental aid to 70 families affected by the gas pipeline fire in Putra Heights, Subang Jaya.

Borhan Aman Shah.

State housing and culture committee chairman Borhan Aman Shah said the rental aid of RM2,000 per month was transferred directly into the victims’ accounts by the Selangor Housing and Property Board, Bernama reported.

“Menteri besar Amirudin Shari instructed that the aid be deposited directly into their accounts.

“The assistance, totalling RM6,000 for three months, has been transferred to about 70 families so far through the board,” he was quoted as saying.

According to Borhan, the number of recipients was expected to increase next week as the process was now being managed by various agencies.

Previously, Amirudin said 396 heads of households affected by the Putra Heights fire will receive six months’ worth of rental assistance.

The April 1 fire wrecked 81 homes, with structural damage exceeding 40%.

Another 81 homes were partially damaged, 57 affected but not burned, while 218 homes remained unaffected, including those in Kampung Tengah, Puchong.",1.74578E+12,en,-0.440692514,2025-04-27 09:42:37,"['borhan', 'per', 'family', 'transferred', 'quoted', 'head', 'including', 'epa', 'household', 'kampung', 'tengah', 'gas', 'board', 'resulted', 'instructed', 'expected', 'menteri', 'damage', 'another', 'amirudin', 'pipeline', 'besar', 'far', 'shari', 'month', 'totalling', 'putra', 'worth', 'height', 'aman', 'three', 'number', 'committee', 'increase', 'recipient', 'wrecked', 'remained', 'housing', 'unaffected', 'structural', 'state', 'petaling', 'previously', 'account', 'chairman', 'selangor', 'assistance', 'damaged', 'puchong', 'agency', 'jaya', 'partially', 'suffering', 'subang', 'bernama', 'six', 'pic', 'victim', 'reported', 'week', 'fire', 'disbursed', 'rental', 'saying', 'culture', 'according', 'receive', 'government', 'shah', 'directly', 'managed', 'property', 'aid', 'home', 'next', 'affected', 'april', 'various', 'said', 'deposited', 'exceeding', 'burned', 'image', 'process']",Neutral

The world's leading oil exporter is investing billions of dollars to achieve its Vision 2030 plan, which focuses on reducing its reliance on oil, and spending more on infrastructure to boost industries like tourism, sports and manufacturing.

PEKON : A charred Myanmar hillside is wreathed by flames, spewing ochre smoke that smothers out sunlight in an apocalyptic scene.

But the villagers who set it ablaze dance below in a ceremony celebrating the inferno as a moment of regeneration and hope.

“It’s a tradition from our ancestors,” said Joseph, a youth leader from Tha Yu village in Myanmar’s eastern Shan state.

“It’s the only way we survive,” added Joseph, who goes by only one name.

Every year between January and April, Southeast Asia is plagued by smog from farmers lighting fires to clear land, emitting microscopic PM 2.5 pollution that lines the lungs and enters the bloodstream.

Myanmar residents lose 2.3 years of life expectancy as a result of pollution from farming fires and other sources, according to analysis of 2022 data by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.

Since a 2021 coup, the country has been riven by a civil war between the military and a patchwork of anti-coup partisans and ethnic minority armed groups, leaving the toll from pollution largely ignored.

But in Tha Yu village there are additional tensions – between the old ways of agriculture and new knowledge about environmental risks.

“We don’t have any other work or opportunities in our region,” said Joseph, 27, as haze swallowed the hills behind him, scorched to make way for paddy rice, chilli and corn.

“So we are forced into this tradition every year.”

‘Not getting rich’

Most agricultural burn-off happens when farmers incinerate the stubble of old harvests in their fields to make room for the new, and to fertilise the soil.

But the smoke billowing around Tha Yu village is from “slash and burn” agriculture – a method also called shifting cultivation, in which patches of wild vegetation are burnt for similar purposes, with crops planted for only a few growing cycles.

“If possible, we want to try other agricultural methods but we don’t have any technology and no one has taught us,” said Joseph.

Environmentalists generally say slash and burn farming can be twice as harmful because it lays waste to tracts of existing plant life which would otherwise absorb carbon dioxide emissions.

But a 2023 study in Belize suggested Indigenous “slash and burn” farming done in intermediate size patches of land could have a positive effect on forest diversity by opening up space for new growth.

In the Tha Yu ceremony, villagers in white headbands dance on stage before lighting a symbolic bundle of brush, swaying and clapping their hands in rhythmic celebration.

Dark tendrils of smoke creep into the sky.

“I can surely say we are not getting rich from shifting cultivation,” said Khun Be Sai, a member of the local area’s cultural committee.

“We do it just to get by day to day.”

Shifting mindset

Air quality monitoring is neither practical nor a priority in war-torn Myanmar, where more than half the population lives in poverty and 3.5 million people are displaced.

But the toll from air pollution only adds to those woes.

“Clean air is very important for your health,” said Thailand’s Kasetsart University environmental economist Witsanu Attavanich. “It’s kind of a basic thing.”

“If you don’t have it you have less healthy people, a lower quality of human capital. How can the country improve without good health?”

Tha Yu is in an area controlled by the Kayan New Land Party, an ethnic minority armed group.

Khun Be Sai says hundreds of villages in the region still practise slash and burn farming, but Tha Yu is the only place that marks it with a formal ceremony.

But he sees little to celebrate in the landscape altered by climate change around the village.

“We are experiencing more natural disasters. The forests are thinning and water retention is decreasing. We are experiencing soil erosion due to heavy rains,” he said.

While the ceremony lauds the practice that sustains their community, Khun Be Sai also sees a dwindling of their way of life.

“People are leaving and living in different places,” he said.

“Our identities, our origins, language and literature are disappearing and being swallowed by others.”",1.74585E+12,en,-0.579456508,2025-04-28 02:00:12,"['sunlight', 'stage', 'hseebu', 'village', 'celebrate', 'clean', 'knowledge', 'ancestor', 'carbon', 'controlled', 'scorched', 'work', 'rich', 'billowing', 'erosion', 'flame', 'resident', 'eastern', 'policy', 'military', 'hill', 'tendril', 'white', 'disaster', 'analysis', 'origin', 'southeast', 'dioxide', 'way', 'say', 'practise', 'hillside', 'altered', 'cultivation', 'diversity', 'space', 'slash', 'around', 'civil', 'survive', 'harvest', 'bundle', 'displaced', 'intermediate', 'try', 'environmentalist', 'existing', 'dont', 'ablaze', 'agriculture', 'identity', 'taught', 'celebration', 'tha', 'energy', 'tract', 'enters', 'swallowed', 'waste', 'kind', 'sai', 'tradition', 'khun', 'chilli', 'plant', 'source', 'priority', 'january', 'ochre', 'witsanu', 'others', 'year', 'slashandburn', 'lung', 'suggested', 'toll', 'moment', 'change', 'myanmar', 'leader', 'scene', 'lose', 'added', 'kayah', 'hope', 'absorb', 'microscopic', 'belize', 'creep', 'member', 'asia', 'wartorn', 'taking', 'could', 'lighting', 'committee', 'university', 'monitoring', 'leaving', 'charred', 'opportunity', 'thailand', 'decreasing', 'rice', 'cultural', 'living', 'patchwork', 'emitting', 'paddy', 'additional', 'since', 'also', 'generally', 'area', 'good', 'improve', 'farming', 'woe', 'patch', 'dwindling', 'forced', 'shifting', 'hand', 'different', 'ceremony', 'afp', 'partisan', 'burnt', 'township', 'celebrating', 'planted', 'experiencing', 'literature', 'corn', 'vegetation', 'similar', 'one', 'group', 'room', 'kayan', 'old', 'state', 'institute', 'basic', 'place', 'possible', 'sustains', 'wreathed', 'set', 'party', 'called', 'expectancy', 'clear', 'smoke', 'otherwise', 'positive', 'rhythmic', 'less', 'important', 'make', 'smother', 'technology', 'headband', 'symbolic', 'haze', 'farmer', 'without', 'dance', 'coup', 'youth', 'mark', 'plagued', 'natural', 'brush', 'lauds', 'see', 'life', 'lower', 'name', 'tension', 'anticoup', 'smog', 'purpose', 'landscape', 'indigenous', 'get', 'disappearing', 'water', 'pekon', 'region', 'emission', 'sky', 'kasetsart', 'environmental', 'million', 'little', 'result', 'poverty', 'bloodstream', 'health', 'capital', 'wild', 'burn', 'done', 'harmful', 'joseph', 'country', 'war', 'economist', 'crop', 'riven', 'pic', 'neither', 'fertilise', 'method', 'clapping', 'effect', 'heavy', 'every', 'practical', 'people', 'agricultural', 'thing', 'happens', 'minority', 'stubble', 'climate', 'field', 'retention', 'fire', 'getting', 'incinerate', 'size', 'growth', 'would', 'rain', 'community', 'human', 'soil', 'add', 'according', 'inferno', 'study', 'population', 'part', 'want', 'half', 'spewing', 'air', 'behind', 'growing', 'attavanich', 'day', 'formal', 'apocalyptic', 'practice', 'largely', 'mindset', 'cycle', 'healthy', 'burnoff', 'surely', 'forest', 'local', 'lay', 'regeneration', 'line', 'language', 'data', 'still', 'april', 'due', 'villager', 'land', 'swaying', 'said', 'pollution', 'ignored', 'opening', 'dark', 'festival', 'risk', 'thinning', 'armed', 'quality', 'new', 'hundred', 'ethnic', 'chicago', 'twice']",Negative

TAWAU:

Kukusan Assemblywoman Datuk Rina Jainal reaffirmed she remains a registered member of Parti Harapan Rakyat Sabah (PHRS), dismissing speculation of a rift between her and PHRS President Tan Sri Liew Yun Fah.

The Political Secretary to the Finance Minister is also understood to still hold the position of Deputy President of PHRS and is a member of the Supreme Council of Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS).

When asked whether she would contest the 17th State Election under the PHRS banner to defend her Kukusan seat, Rina responded that she preferred to focus on completing her current term.

“Ultimately, we leave it to the party leadership. For me, the best kind of politics is simply doing the work. The leadership is experienced enough to make the best decision,” she said.

Rina added that there is still much to be done in Kukusan and that she is enthusiastic about being involved in development plans for both the constituency and Sabah in general.

She dismissed claims that she left Parti Warisan to join PHRS for personal financial gain.

“Personal gain? That’s never been our focus — that’s not how we operate. We just focus on doing the work in our area.

“But that’s the nature of politics. No matter what we say, there will always be opposing views trying to paint us as traitors and so on.”

She said her responsibilities go beyond representing youth and women, with her efforts often centred on resolving infrastructure issues in Kukusan as well as broader challenges across the constituency.

By Amar-Singh HSS

As a nation many of us find ourselves in a worse state of hopelessness and despair than we had been in the past.

I wrote this many, many months ago but held on from sending my opinion, in the hope that things would improve.

They have sadly worsened; as a nation, we have continued to deteriorate.

When we, civil society and many in Malaysia, were fighting to rid ourselves of corrupt and dictatorial leaders and governments, we had hope – hope for a change in government that would do what was right and just and fair for all in Malaysia.

But now, with that government seemingly in place, a government built on the word hope (harapan), we hardly see any meaningful reform or change. We see the same political compromises that allow corruption to continue. We continue to see institutional systems and legislation that deny basic human rights.

Civil society has had to fight even harder to prevent change that would worsen the state of the marginalised community in Malaysia.

We had hoped that this government would institute critical reforms that would bring a measure of justice to our beloved nation. We had hoped for a government that focused on humanity in their dealings with all the people who inhabit this land. Many of us had hoped that children would have their feet placed on the path to a brighter future.

All the current leadership seems to be interested in is maintaining its position and figuring out how to win the next election at any cost – even if it means a compromise of many moral principles. They appear to have morphed back into the previous governments they were elected to replace.

All too often elected representatives we had hoped in behave like lords rather than serving the community. They can no longer receive criticisms and seem to think that only their opinions are right. They appear to have forgotten the needs of the people whom they were elected to serve.

We do not need politicians who speak loudly about a problem in some far away country. Yes, we should speak up about injustice in any nation. But first please fix your own house, our beloved nation, where we have blatant injustice.

We have systems that neglect and victimise children; we have a stateless problem that is ignored with children victimised and traumatised. It is time to stop such repressive behaviour in Malaysia. Our health services are dying, our social services weak, our education services in a shambles. The civil service needs major reform.

In reality, we have lost hope and many are in a state of despair. We have lost hope in the government bringing the change we had all worked together for.

This loss of hope is worse than when we were struggling against corrupt and dictatorial governments of the past. Now the ones we had put our hope in have failed and demoralised us.

There are some good politicians who are down to earth and do good work for the people; sadly, they are few in number. The vast majority of leaders whom we had hoped in, have become silent and in doing so become complicit in the actions of the whole.

Dear leaders whom we helped elect to bring meaningful change to our nation, your silence is deafening and indefensible.

I wonder if you ever reflect on how outspoken you were about important issues and meaningful change in the past.

You spoke up against corruption and corrupt practices.

You spoke up for children and women, those who were disabled, poor, marginalised and victimised.

You spoke up for those who were stateless and in detention.

Now you are silent or give lame excuses to try and explain away your compromised principles. You are no longer the people we voted for but have become tainted by power and the comfort of your position.

Where then do we find hope for Malaysia?

We find hope in the average people, especially the poor. They are not greedy but willing to help others.

We find hope in some of our youth who can see clearly our nation’s peril and try to make a difference.

We find hope in many civil society groups that support marginalised communities, despite the adverse conditions they find themselves in.

We find hope in the Eternal and the Divine that is not mocked or fooled by the semblance or facade that the government puts up.

If you, MPs and state assembly members want to continue to be our elected representatives, then please represent all the people. Drop your “YB” (Yang Berhormat or The Honourable) label.

As some previous MPs said, YB should stand for “Yang Berkhidmat” (In Service). Remember you are not a lord but a person elected by the people to serve them. So be humble and focus on the pressing issues facing the people.

Spend time with the poorest of the poor in your constituency – not with an entourage, not with reporters, not with videos or images recorded. Just sit and listen with an open heart to the people’s concerns and see how you can bring help to them.

Be accessible often to the people in your community – directly accessible, not through your representatives. And listen to us, not talk.

Stop all the petty distractions that fill our media, and focus and speak up on the big issues and injustice that is plaguing the country – poverty, economic concerns, disharmony, disability accessibility, children’s rights and protection…

We look to the Divine to bring back our hope, to lift us from this despair and to help us find courage to work again to build our nation.

We look to the people of Malaysia who desire a better nation for everyone.

It is time to find new leaders who will work for the people.

climate_change,Why SDG13 matters to Sabah Electricity,1.74563E+12,Daily Express Malaysia,www.dailyexpress.com.my,https://news.google.com/read/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOVE5zUWhEVmVQOWxELXAxeTdGTzFtZ04tbl9hQzdmR1lGZWxweHczQVR3RDJDWEpLUXBqZUVsNnNyNDBOMUcwTVlGc1hmdDZUYWhCRXp2VXJCR3BqYnBJUWp6VVhucTB1clJIUVVpaFRWTnJaZ2YyRlJOeGN3WkxVSUFLYkNMTzRT?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://www.dailyexpress.com.my/read/6057/why-sdg13-matters-to-sabah-electricity/,"Why SDG13 matters to Sabah Electricity

Climate change isn’t a distant idea anymore. It is here, and it’s already reshaping how we live and work.

When people talk about climate change, they often picture melting ice caps or rising sea levels in faraway places. But for us at Sabah Electricity, the effects of climate change are not distant or theoretical but they are right here, on our land, impacting our grid, damaging our infrastructure, and threatening our ability to serve the people of Sabah.

That’s why we take Sustainable Development Goal (SDG13) dedicated to Climate Action seriously. Not because it’s trendy, or because we have to, but because we’ve seen what happens when nature strikes and we aren’t prepared.

The truth is, we need climate action not as a slogan, but as a survival strategy.

Over the past year alone, we’ve experienced first-hand how natural disasters can paralyze the electricity supply in Sabah. Remember the landslide in Kampung

Nabutan? That wasn’t just a normal landslide as it occurred right near the 275kV transmission towers that are part of the backbone of our grid.

These towers connect the west coast and east coast of Sabah, carrying roughly 200 megawatts of electricity every day. If they had fallen, the entire east coast could have plunged into darkness.

That’s not just a technical issue but also a disruption to homes, schools, clinics, and factories. That’s the real-world consequence of not acting fast enough to protect our infrastructure from the shifting earth beneath our feet.

The condition of those towers became very critical. There was no village nearby, no people around to help, just deep forest and unstable soil. And yet, 30 of our Sabah Electricity staff, 30 from TNB, and 20 contractors went deep into those high-risk areas to prevent collapse.

They knew the stakes. They knew that for every bolt tightened, every reinforcement made, they were protecting the daily lives of thousands across Sabah.

And what about the disaster in Tenom? On 31 October 2022, the Tenom Pangi Hydro Power Station, one of Sabah’s key sources of renewable energy was hit by a massive landslide and mud flood. Three turbines were damaged. We lost 66 megawatts of generation capacity overnight.

That’s clean energy gone. That’s a dent in our generation portfolio. That’s power we could not deliver to the people. And again, nature didn’t wait for us to be ready. It came in full force.

These are not rare events anymore. They are becoming more frequent, more intense, and costlier. Toppled electric poles, broken distribution lines, flooded substations. Every time something like this happens, it puts our system under stress.

And every time our system is under stress, the people of Sabah feel it, whether it’s in the form of a blackout, load shedding, or delayed restoration works. This is why SDG13 matters to us, not as a formality, but as a foundation of power stability and asset protection.

Here in this company, we see SDG13 as a lifeline. When we talk about “green initiatives,” we’re not just talking about planting trees or cutting carbon, we’re talking about investing in infrastructure that survives, about building systems that bend but don’t break, and about planning for a future where power is reliable, even in the face of floods, storms, and landslides.

These things are not luxuries, they’re necessities.

That’s why for us, SDG13 Climate Action isn’t just about protecting the environment. It’s about protecting our assets, our power system, and the lives and livelihoods of the people who count on us every day.

It’s easy to overlook how much the power grid depends on the land around it staying still and predictable. But the earth is moving, the rains are heavier, the storms are stronger. And Sabah’s geography, while beautiful, makes us even more vulnerable.

That’s why SESB isn’t sitting on the side-lines. We’re reinforcing our towers, upgrading our monitoring systems, and doing everything we can to build resilience into our grid.

But beyond the technical work, we also see the need to shift mindsets—ours, our partners’, and the public’s. Climate change isn’t just the responsibility of scientists and NGOs. It’s everyone’s problem.

And in our case, it’s directly linked to whether homes have light, hospitals have power, and industries keep moving. If we want to keep the lights on, we have to care about the earth we’re standing on.

So yes, Sabah Electricity supports SDG13. Fully. Not because someone told us to, but because we’ve seen what happens when we don’t. The path forward means embracing sustainability in real, practical ways, not only for the environment but for the future of electricity in Sabah.",1.7457E+12,en,-0.524681866,2025-04-26 01:47:31,"['lost', 'reshaping', 'full', 'time', 'load', 'beyond', 'flood', 'tower', 'staff', 'hit', 'village', 'carrying', 'clean', 'dent', 'stability', 'supply', 'geography', 'across', 'carbon', 'critical', 'work', 'earth', 'electric', 'plunged', 'storm', 'nearby', 'intense', 'massive', 'generation', 'pole', 'distant', 'became', 'planting', 'grid', 'scientist', 'embracing', 'disaster', 'nature', 'reinforcement', 'delayed', 'build', 'way', 'sea', 'clinic', 'overnight', 'standing', 'real', 'paralyze', 'light', 'kampung', 'ice', 'protecting', 'foundation', 'break', 'around', 'yet', 'condition', 'vulnerable', 'sustainability', 'station', 'costlier', 'survives', 'dont', 'forward', 'past', 'someone', 'matter', 'energy', 'face', 'nabutan', 'ready', 'distribution', 'rare', 'stress', 'strike', 'care', 'connect', 'dedicated', 'already', 'factory', 'heavier', 'firsthand', 'threatening', 'sideline', 'source', 'fully', 'unstable', 'contractor', 'daily', 'year', 'change', 'often', 'infrastructure', 'collapse', 'stronger', 'landslide', 'live', 'broken', 'remember', 'investing', 'idea', 'responsibility', 'three', 'could', 'advertisement', 'serve', 'beneath', 'theoretical', 'realworld', 'event', 'monitoring', 'power', 'picture', 'protect', 'moving', 'also', 'depends', 'area', 'stake', 'went', 'key', 'feel', 'toppled', 'shifting', 'fallen', 'path', 'mean', 'occurred', 'protection', 'predictable', 'survival', 'alone', 'one', 'blackout', 'asset', 'bend', 'upgrading', 'knew', 'renewable', 'normal', 'easy', 'prevent', 'talk', 'rising', 'place', 'form', 'trendy', 'truth', 'near', 'consequence', 'didnt', 'issue', 'make', 'mud', 'everything', 'force', 'frequent', 'slogan', 'thousand', 'foot', 'gone', 'green', 'tenom', 'natural', 'see', 'transmission', 'backbone', 'deep', 'impacting', 'prepared', 'life', 'entire', 'talking', 'future', 'case', 'damaged', 'sdg', 'something', 'faraway', 'pangi', 'sesb', 'support', 'development', 'disruption', 'reliable', 'arent', 'planning', 'enough', 'resilience', 'overlook', 'livelihood', 'everyones', 'luxury', 'keep', 'lifeline', 'building', 'need', 'yes', 'flooded', 'necessity', 'becoming', 'action', 'hydro', 'coast', 'acting', 'ability', 'formality', 'megawatt', 'deliver', 'technical', 'mindsetsours', 'bolt', 'effect', 'shedding', 'capacity', 'every', 'anymore', 'people', 'west', 'thing', 'practical', 'happens', 'climate', 'strategy', 'electricity', 'ngo', 'company', 'made', 'help', 'portfolio', 'fast', 'tree', 'rain', 'right', 'roughly', 'soil', 'east', 'partner', 'theyre', 'public', 'system', 'october', 'experienced', 'part', 'want', 'thats', 'cutting', 'wait', 'staying', 'directly', 'substation', 'day', 'count', 'take', 'highrisk', 'beautiful', 'wasnt', 'school', 'goal', 'came', 'environment', 'home', 'forest', 'problem', 'put', 'much', 'sabah', 'initiative', 'weve', 'darkness', 'line', 'whether', 'restoration', 'sitting', 'still', 'isnt', 'reinforcing', 'industry', 'turbine', 'land', 'melting', 'level', 'hospital', 'even', 'seriously', 'sustainable', 'seen', 'cap', 'tnb', 'tightened', 'shift', 'linked', 'told', 'like', 'damaging']",Negative

(Instagram pic)

PETALING JAYA : A total of 112 Malayan tapirs were killed in road accidents nationwide between 2020 and last year, says natural resources and environmental sustainability minister Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad.

Nik Nazmi said the latest data from the wildlife and national parks department shows only about 700 to 800 Malayan tapirs remain in their natural habitats.

He said the ministry has implemented various initiatives to address this issue.

“We have installed yellow transverse bars, LED wildlife crossing signboards, and solar amber lights in Gerik, Perak and Kedah.

“We are also open to expanding these measures to other areas, including in Selangor, where cases of tapir deaths have been reported,” Bernama reported him as saying at the Wildlife Conservation Centre at Sungai Dusun in Kuala Kubu Baharu, Hulu Selangor, today.

On attempts to breed the Malayan tapir, Nik Nazmi said the ministry will continue to intensify conservation efforts through both in-situ (in natural habitats) and ex-situ (outside natural habitats, such as conservation centres) approaches.

“In addition, habitat protection will be strengthened through the construction of wildlife crossings at the Sungai Deka Ecological Corridor in Terengganu, the Sungai Yu Ecological Corridor in Pahang and the Gerik Ecological Corridor.

“We have already begun work on the construction of the National Tapir Conservation Centre at the Kenaboi Forest Reserve in Jelebu, Negeri Sembilan,” he said.",1.74578E+12,en,-0.063668571,2025-04-26 10:42:14,"['minister', 'strengthened', 'malayan', 'work', 'road', 'sustainability', 'including', 'say', 'intensify', 'addition', 'light', 'continue', 'conservation', 'transverse', 'ecological', 'tapir', 'kubu', 'jelebu', 'instagram', 'sungai', 'already', 'last', 'nationwide', 'year', 'habitat', 'construction', 'number', 'park', 'crossing', 'show', 'also', 'death', 'area', 'address', 'outside', 'accident', 'kenaboi', 'protection', 'signboard', 'today', 'ministry', 'latest', 'insitu', 'petaling', 'expanding', 'nazmi', 'sembilan', 'issue', 'begun', 'selangor', 'led', 'open', 'centre', 'natural', 'numerous', 'kedah', 'case', 'ahmad', 'decline', 'effort', 'jaya', 'dusun', 'environmental', 'perak', 'measure', 'bernama', 'corridor', 'deka', 'installed', 'gerik', 'killed', 'pic', 'amber', 'bar', 'implemented', 'reported', 'national', 'approach', 'saying', 'remain', 'attempt', 'total', 'terengganu', 'carried', 'baharu', 'negeri', 'wildlife', 'kuala', 'exsitu', 'breed', 'forest', 'initiative', 'data', 'various', 'department', 'said', 'nik', 'hulu', 'solar', 'resource', 'reserve', 'yellow', 'pahang']",Neutral

He said that the decision was made following the presentation of findings from studies conducted by Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS) and Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS) to the committee recently. “Initial findings indicate that one of the main factors contributing to the high prices of goods in both states is the high logistics cost of transporting goods from Peninsular Malaysia,"" he told reporters after attending the Rahmah MADANI Sales programme at Emart Riam, here, today.

He said that although certain goods are cheaper in Sarawak compared with Peninsular Malaysia, the prices of most daily necessities remain higher, due to geographical factors and shipping costs. The two technical committees would involve collaboration with the two universities and will be co-chaired by representatives from both the federal and state governments, comprising either ministers or deputy ministers. “Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Fadillah Yusof will soon hold a meeting with the Premier of Sarawak, to discuss the appointment of the chairman and deputy chairman of the technical committee in Sarawak, while I will personally meet with the Chief Minister of Sabah, Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor, for the same purpose,” he explained.

According to him, in Sabah, one of the initial areas of focus identified is the price of chicken, a primary source of protein, where studies found that chicken prices remain high, despite the presence of many local chicken farms. In addition, basic goods such as sugar are also a concern, as Sabah and Sarawak do not have their own sugar refineries, further contributing to higher costs. With the establishment of the technical committees, the government aims to develop long-term action plans, including allocation planning under the 13th Malaysia Plan (13MP), currently being finalised through the Ministry of Economy, to strengthen food security and stabilise prices in Sabah and Sarawak.",1.74578E+12,en,-0.2136738,2025-04-26 14:49:55,"['certain', 'minister', 'deputy', 'following', 'meeting', 'finalised', 'peninsular', 'emart', 'found', 'high', 'including', 'appointment', 'addition', 'either', 'soon', 'trade', 'yusof', 'seri', 'finding', 'develop', 'security', 'transporting', 'mohd', 'specific', 'decision', 'collaboration', 'armizan', 'plan', 'representative', 'allocation', 'logistics', 'domestic', 'food', 'source', 'daily', 'miri', 'farm', 'programme', 'madani', 'presence', 'committee', 'university', 'primary', 'living', 'geographical', 'also', 'hajiji', 'good', 'area', 'recently', 'address', 'shipping', 'although', 'one', 'refinery', 'today', 'state', 'explained', 'factor', 'ministry', 'comprising', 'fadillah', 'basic', 'datuk', 'sarawak', 'noor', 'ali', 'protein', 'issue', 'hold', 'chairman', 'two', 'personally', 'cochaired', 'purpose', 'chicken', 'reporter', 'federal', 'planning', 'cost', 'riam', 'premier', 'bernama', 'higher', 'price', 'universiti', 'sugar', 'necessity', 'action', 'presentation', 'strengthen', 'identified', 'indicate', 'technical', 'focus', 'despite', 'strategy', 'rahmah', 'made', 'main', 'longterm', 'would', 'remain', 'meet', 'conducted', 'study', 'according', 'compared', 'stabilise', 'contributing', 'concern', 'initial', 'aim', 'government', 'economy', 'cheaper', 'formulate', 'ums', 'targeted', 'local', 'sabah', 'chief', 'due', 'april', 'establishment', 'unimas', 'sale', 'malaysia', 'involve', 'said', 'many', 'attending', 'established', 'currently', 'prime', 'discus', 'told']",Neutral

UOB Kay Hian Wealth Advisors Sdn Bhd head of investment research Mohd Sedek Jantan said that compounding the cautious tone, next week will be a shortened trading week, with Bursa Malaysia closed on Thursday in observance of Labour Day — potentially weighing on liquidity and limiting upward momentum.

“Despite the recent gains, the FBM KLCI has struggled to decisively breach the psychological resistance level at 1,515 — a level we previously highlighted as critical.

“This hesitation introduces uncertainty regarding the sustainability of the current uptrend heading into next week,” he told Bernama.

He said that after the recent three consecutive days of gains, profit-taking may intensify, particularly among retail investors seeking to lock in short-term gains amid ongoing policy uncertainties.

“While the absence of foreign selling is encouraging, confirmation of sustained inflows — pending Friday’s foreign investors’ data — would be a constructive signal and may support positive momentum into early May.

“Export-oriented counters remain well-positioned to outperform, provided there is no further escalation in US trade policy,” he added.

Nonetheless, Mohd Sedek said sentiment remains fragile and highly sensitive to geopolitical developments.

“Investors should continue to monitor external headlines closely, as any abrupt policy shifts could derail the nascent recovery,” he said.

Regarding the positive market sentiment following the meeting between Investment, Trade and Industry Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz and the United States (US) officials in Washington, along with the easing of US-China trade tensions, he remarked that these developments have come at the right time.

“Export-oriented stocks (index-linked components) began rising after midday, contributing to the upward movement of the FBM KLCI, which climbed up at 3.30 pm on Friday amid choppy trading.

“Additionally, foreign institutional investors generally increase their participation in the Malaysian market during the afternoon session, coinciding with higher liquidity levels observed in the latter part of the trading day.

“We’re hopeful that today (Friday) will see net foreign buying,” he added.

Meanwhile, Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd equity research vice-president Thong Pak Leng believes investors are ready to buy the breakout at around 1,518, add to their positions, or use leveraged tools to maximise profits as the benchmark index is showing signs of recovery after reclaiming the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA).

“The gap between the 20-day and 50-day EMA is narrowing, hinting at a potential convergence that could develop into a bullish crossover if momentum continues.

“As such, we anticipate the FBM KLCI to trend within the range of 1,490-1,520 for next week,” he added.

On a Friday-to-Friday basis, the key index gained 9.80 points to 1,509.20 from 1,499.40 a week earlier.

climate_change,Why ASEAN should push for a trade pact with the EU,1.74572E+12,Nation Thailand,www.nationthailand.com,https://news.google.com/read/CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE80UkFMLU4xd0lwNUVFT0J5REJDc0lIX0FnaUl5cE9LbDRpZWFBZVFscWFsNVdzVnBadDJ0MlBYMmhTOU1ONVFNQnNPaUtxTk9KR1BuYUJ0SFRPVTk2VGFidUVTQUpvTnM?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://www.nationthailand.com/blogs/news/asean/40049286,"China has taken a predictably combative stance. Framing the CBAM as a disguised tariff, Beijing argues that the policy violates World Trade Organisation (WTO) norms.

Behind the scenes, however, China is ramping up its national emissions trading scheme (ETS), which in 2024 covered over 40 per cent of national emissions, including power, steel and cement, aiming to align with global carbon pricing trends. It has also achieved dominance in global green technologies, from electric vehicles to solar panels.

Thus, while publicly critical, China is well-positioned to benefit from global decarbonization, poised to adapt and even shape the emerging climate-trade nexus.

ASEAN’s response, however, has been more fragmented. Singapore and Vietnam have signed FTAs with the EU, while Indonesia is negotiating one with Brussels. These countries are cautiously adjusting to the new regulatory landscape.

Their motivations are clear: the EU remains one of their largest export destinations, particularly for goods like electronics, rubber and palm oil.

Yet the cost of compliance is steep, especially for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), which lack the financial and technological capacity to quantify or reduce their emissions.

Malaysia and Thailand, meanwhile, have expressed concern over the fairness and timing of the CBAM. They fear a new kind of non-tariff barrier dressed in the language of sustainability but applied unevenly.

Without appropriate support for technology transfer, such as carbon capture or capacity building, the CBAM risks penalising countries that have contributed the least to global emissions yet stand to lose the most economically.

At the heart of this debate is the concept of carbon credits, a market-based mechanism designed to put a price on emissions. Carbon markets can be voluntary or compliance-based, domestic or international. While in theory polluters pay and clean actors are rewarded, the practice is fraught with asymmetry.

Critics argue that carbon markets can entrench global inequities. As EU trade policy specialists like Chad Damro have argued, the EU’s extraterritorial economic and trade policies may reinforce a “hierarchical global order”, where rich countries dictate rules while less well-off ones absorb associated adjustment costs. Such concerns are not merely theoretical.

Some developing countries have faced challenges in getting carbon offsets recognised by Western regulators, despite verifiable reductions.

ASEAN cannot afford to remain on the defensive. Instead, it must position itself as a normative actor pushing for fair standards, equitable financing and realistic timelines. Concluding a region-wide EU-ASEAN FTA would be a strategic step in that direction.

The EU and ASEAN represent two of the world’s most dynamic regional blocs. Together, they account for over 15 % of global trade.

Talks for an inter-regional FTA have been on and off since 2007, and stalled since 2009, with bilateral deals, like those with Vietnam and Singapore, moving faster.

But a comprehensive EU-ASEAN FTA would create the regulatory clarity and institutional architecture needed to navigate climate-related trade measures like the CBAM and other initiatives under the ambitious EU Green Deal.

The agreement could promote harmonised environmental standards calibrated to development levels, technical assistance for carbon auditing and compliance and mutual recognition of emissions reporting methodologies.

It should also include provisions for capacity building and green finance, plus a joint mechanism for dispute resolution on climate trade issues.

More importantly, a finalised FTA would provide a diplomatic bulwark against the uncertainties of US trade policy, given the doctrine of “tariffs first, questions later”.

Trump has already targeted China with tariffs reaching 245 per cent on some goods, although China downplayed these as posturing, focusing instead on retaliatory measures. He also threatened US allies, including Japan, South Korea and even ASEAN countries, with punitive trade measures for perceived imbalances or defence dependencies.

With this looming threat, the EU must recognise ASEAN as a vital partner in shaping fairer global standards, not just a passive recipient of rules. A robust EU-ASEAN FTA would shield both regions from potential US trade disruptions while fostering cooperation in key sectors like green hydrogen, clean steel and digital trade.

Such an agreement could amplify existing trade momentum, with ASEAN-EU trade projected to grow 3.5 to 5 per cent annually and increase in volume by 69 per cent by 2031, according to a 2023 Boston Consulting Group study.

The EU’s Green Deal is a bold vision. But without multilateral legitimacy and developmental sensitivity, it risks turning climate policy into a new geopolitical battleground. Asia, particularly China and ASEAN, is not opposed to climate action. What it seeks is a fair transition, one that balances green ambition and regulation with equity and respect.

The EU-ASEAN FTA offers a path forward. It can turn confrontation into cooperation and extraterritorial pressure into a structured partnership. In a world facing a “poly-crisis” of protectionism, regulatory nationalism and climate change, completing this agreement is not a luxury. It is a strategic necessity.

While the 90-day delay in implementing the “reciprocal” tariffs offers a reprieve, it has not alleviated the uncertainty surrounding trade with the United States , with price increases and shortages set to affect all consumers.

This uncertainty, however, could present an opportunity to transform the future of food trade in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations

The Asean region is highly dependent on imports to meet demand for soybeans, corn and wheat.

Muizzu, accompanied by Maldivian Cabinet ministers and senior government officials lan,ded at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) here at 5.31pm on Sunday.

Upon arrival at 6.05pm, he was greeted by a guard of honour consisting of 28 officers and men from the First Battalion of the Royal Ranger Regiment (Ceremonial) at the Bunga Raya Complex.

Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad, who is the minister in attendance for the visit, was present to welcome the delegation.

Muizzu's maiden visit to Malaysia since becoming president in November 2023, was at the invitation of Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.

According to Wisma Putra, Muizzu will be accorded an official welcoming ceremony at Perdana Putra Complex on Monday (April 28), followed by a meeting with Anwar.

Both leaders are expected to take stock of Malaysia–Maldives bilateral relations and explore further collaboration, particularly in trade and investment, the halal industry, education, tourism, and youth and sports.

During the visit, both leaders will witness the exchange of three memoranda of understanding (MOU) — cooperation in the field of tourism, cooperation in the field of sports, and cooperation in the field of health, as well as two exchange of notes (EON) in the areas of diplomatic training, and the establishment of bilateral consultation between Malaysia and the Republic of Maldives.

On Tuesday, Muizzu will be conferred an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Islamic Leadership and Madani Development by the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM).

It will be conferred by Tengku Ampuan Pahang Tunku Azizah Aminah Maimunah Iskandariah, as the constitutional head of IIUM.

In conjunction with the conferment, Muizzu is then scheduled to deliver a public lecture entitled “The Intellectual Renaissance: Unveiling the Scientific and Modern Developments of Islamic Civilisation”.

In 2024, Malaysia’s total trade with Maldives increased by 4.3% to RM862.7 million (US$189 million), from RM827.3 million (US$180.9 million) in 2023, making the archipelagic state Malaysia’s sixth largest trading partner among South Asian countries.

EMERITUS Professor Datuk Dr Azizan Abu Samah, a Universiti Malaya meteorology expert, said floods in Kuala Lumpur are unpredictable because the city is situated on a floodplain.

Climate change has rewritten the rules, too, with floods often striking without warning.

Flash floods now surge through cities and villages at any time, catching communities off guard and leaving destruction in their wake.

We need urgent flood mitigation strategies. We can't afford to wait for the next rainy season.

The recent flash floods in the Klang Valley hit Sungai Buloh, Puchong, Klang and Gombak.

They have once again exposed the urgent need for a more resilient and community-driven approach to flood mitigation.

Highways were paralysed, routines disrupted and critical infrastructure strained, highlighting the limitations of relying on conventional drainage systems and government-led responses.

While structural solutions like the expansion of retention ponds, reinforcement of riverbanks, and the construction of embankments along rivers are commendable, they must be accompanied by a robust and inclusive governance framework.

This is where the principles of Local Agenda 21 (LA21) become essential.

LA21 emphasises sustainable development at the local level through participation of stakeholders, especially local authorities and the community.

The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015 to 2030), endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly, advocates for the active involvement of communities in disaster preparedness and mitigation.

Communities possess local knowledge, which includes understanding the behaviour of rivers, historical flood events and areas most at risk.

Flood-prone areas, including those in the Klang Valley, and more recently in Batu Pahat, require more than top-down engineering solutions.

They need grassroots engagement in the planning and maintenance of flood mitigation systems.

For example, in Batu Pahat, waterways like the main river in Parit Karjo, which drains into the sea in Pekan Senggarang, are filled with overgrown vegetation such as thick grass.

This might seem a minor issue but it drastically reduces water flow, exacerbating the risk of flooding.

If communities were more involved in maintenance and monitoring, such problems could be mitigated before they escalate into disasters.

Although examples of community participation in flood mitigation exist in Malaysia, these efforts need to be significantly strengthened.

One major challenge in community-based flood mitigation is limited public awareness of practical steps to reduce flood risks.

Furthermore, financial constraints pose a significant barrier.

These challenges highlight the need for increased investment in education, resources and capacity-building.

Participatory budgeting would allow residents to prioritise flood mitigation projects based on local needs, enhancing transparency and engagement.

Thus, strengthening disaster mitigation and prevention is not solely the job of government agencies or engineers.

It is a shared responsibility that must be rooted in community participation, inter-agency collaboration and long-term sustainability planning as promoted by Local Agenda 21.

Only through such an inclusive and integrated approach can we hope to protect lives, infrastructure and livelihoods from the devastating impacts of floods.

Who doesn’t want to maximise space to entertain and relax, surrounded by open spaces and lush landscapes? For one family, the connection between the cosiness of their home and the beauty of nature is keenly felt throughout.

According to the homeowner, who only wanted to be known as Genevieve, the idea of building her family’s own home in Malaysia after living abroad for years truly came into being during the pandemic.

While looking for an architect to work with, she and her husband chanced upon Melvyn Kanny of MJ Kanny Architect.

It was Melvyn’s aesthetic, use of natural materials and sensitive approach to sustainability that convinced them.

“When the pandemic hit, my son and I returned to Malaysia first before the rest of the family (my husband and two daughters) joined us. We were staying in this beautiful three-storey house but I discovered that it was tiring going up and down. I didn’t think it was going to be our retirement home. And we were not getting any younger since our three kids were already adults,” shares Genevieve.

“We love a simple life and we wanted to have more outdoor space in our home.”

The gabled roof keeps the main living area cool.

So the family decided to build a house that would, more than anything else, be about nature.

It was built on a plot of land that had remained a blank canvas for years.

The house is situated in a quiet corner in Bukit Jelutong, at the end of a road, and is named The Enclave House for its location.

Despite being newly built, the facade exudes an outdoor-indoor charm, which links to the family’s story.

“We lived in different parts of Africa for about 15 years and there was a particular home that we stayed briefly in South Africa that I really loved. I wanted this new home of ours to feel like that,” explains Genevieve.

Guests entering the home are pleasantly surprised with a water feature and a small tree that create an unexpected outdoor experience.

A lush oasis

The result is a sprawling home that breaks the norm of a typical double-storey Malaysian residence. Taking into consideration the family’s lifestyle and needs, Melvyn and his team created a unique spin to the one-and-a-half-storey home where each room opens up to the landscape, making the most of their natural surroundings.

Entering the 557sq m home, the space opens up to a water feature and a frangipani tree. This sets the tone for the rest of the home, giving visitors a feeling of still being outdoors.

The main section of the one-and-a-half-storey house in the evening.

“Guests who enter our home are always wowed by this, since from the outside, the house is very unassuming. They always say it feels like stepping into a resort and they’d be willing to house sit for us!” laughs Genevieve.

Natural light pours in through the ceiling, which also ventilates the space.

Water features surround the home, creating visual separation between the public and private areas such as the living areas and bedrooms.

This creates a space that is open enough to welcome guests, yet private enough to sequester the family.

According to Genevieve, she considers the kitchen and dining area (outfitted with a terrace that overlooks the garden) as the central focus of the home. And it’s her favourite part of the house.

“I simply love spending time there. Plus, we love having people over so the home is designed in a way that the kitchen, dining room, guest room and TV area are all in the same section. This allows us to host guests easily at home while also having the option for a quiet night in as a family separately,” she adds.

The master bedroom opens up to the garden.

Keeping it personal

Every inch of the house offers glimpses of the family’s years abroad, evident of the many intricate African-themed decor.

An impressive African wooden boat sculpture that they got in 2007, alongside several glass beads from Ghana, now sits proudly in the main living area.

Adds Genevieve, “We’ve also managed to keep most of the furniture from our previous home. We love wood and you can see in almost every area of the house there is some element of wood.”

In keeping with the overall home’s natural and unfinished aesthetic, load-bearing hollow concrete walls were kept in their natural rugged finish and plastered walls were left unpainted.

The homeowner never tires of the beautiful garden view she gets from the kitchen.

“We purposely kept the walls like this and it’s made the upkeep easy! You will also find concrete vent blocks along walkways that provide natural ventilation and add character to the home,” says Genevieve.

Education Malaysia Global Services (EMGS) said international students, including from China, are shifting away from the world’s ‘Big Four’ study destinations: the UK, US, Australia and Canada.

“More students are exploring dynamic and diverse destinations across Asia. Malaysia is one of the top destinations,” it told The Star.

EMGS, which is under the purview of the Higher Education Ministry, said its data shows that students from China continued to top the list of study applications to Malaysia, at 33,216 in 2024, compared to 26,627 applications in 2023.

Other top applications came from Bangladesh (6,917), Indonesia (5,556), India (2,591) and Pakistan (2,417).

From January to March this, application by students from China continued to grow by 2%, rising to 5,876 from 5,780 in the same period last year.

EMGS said Malaysia’s multilingual environment, political stability, safety, as well as rich cultural experiences, are motivating factors for China students to pursue their studies in the country.

“Malaysia's geographical proximity to China also makes it easier and more affordable for students to travel back home during holidays and maintain close ties with their families.”

China Daily recently reported that more Chinese families are reconsidering higher education plans in the US due to worsening bilateral relations and growing concerns over safety abroad.

Parents, the report said, are considering countries that have a good relationship with China as political stability ensures the safety of their children abroad.

The report also indicated that data from the 2024 Open Doors Report on Inter¬national Educational Exchange showed that China was surpassed by India as the largest source of international students in the United States for the 2023-2024 academic year.

There were 277,398 students from the Chinese mainland enrolled in US higher education institutions during that period, a figure that has been dropping annually since peaking at 372,532 in the 2019-2020 academic year.

EMGS said Malaysia, under the Education Blueprint 2015-2025, is targeting 250,000 international students by 2025 with 39% contributed by China.

“The consistent rise in international student applications, along with a student-friendly visa system, reflects Malaysia’s commitment to transforming into a global classroom and strengthening its global influence and soft power,” said EMGS.

It added that Malaysia offers internationally recognized degrees, often in partnership with prestigious universities from the UK, Australia, and the US, allowing students to earn a reputable degree at a fraction of the cost.

“The qualification from Malaysia is also widely-recognised and highly regarded in China so students are able to find jobs easily after graduation.”",1.74586E+12,en,0.273306251,2025-04-27 23:01:01,"['four', 'emg', 'family', 'stability', 'annually', 'across', 'indicated', 'china', 'rich', 'highly', 'bangladesh', 'including', 'period', 'allowing', 'india', 'australia', 'regarded', 'multilingual', 'contributed', 'holiday', 'largest', 'diverse', 'plan', 'considering', 'travel', 'educational', 'proximity', 'offer', 'recognized', 'last', 'enrolled', 'source', 'january', 'political', 'world', 'year', 'daily', 'surpassed', 'grow', 'often', 'driven', 'added', 'strengthening', 'malaysian', 'asia', 'number', 'international', 'university', 'mainland', 'reputable', 'power', 'applying', 'show', 'cultural', 'geographical', 'also', 'exchange', 'since', 'good', 'recently', 'application', 'shifting', 'student', 'academic', 'grew', 'experience', 'prestigious', 'one', 'united', 'internationally', 'chinese', 'parent', 'ministry', 'state', 'factor', 'rise', 'rising', 'commitment', 'petaling', 'earn', 'make', 'maintain', 'well', 'safety', 'open', 'partnership', 'purview', 'soft', 'pakistan', 'tie', 'peaking', 'relationship', 'motivating', 'worsening', 'qualification', 'big', 'pursue', 'canada', 'education', 'transforming', 'targeting', 'figure', 'jaya', 'widelyrecognised', 'cost', 'blueprint', 'studentfriendly', 'job', 'degree', 'star', 'global', 'service', 'visa', 'exploring', 'higher', 'close', 'list', 'easier', 'abroad', 'graduation', 'country', 'door', 'easily', 'dynamic', 'consistent', 'able', 'influence', 'reported', 'report', 'affordable', 'fraction', 'study', 'institution', 'compared', 'concern', 'mobility', 'system', 'relation', 'dropping', 'growing', 'away', 'came', 'environment', 'child', 'showed', 'home', 'classroom', 'find', 'top', 'data', 'indonesia', 'due', 'reflects', 'back', 'malaysia', 'said', 'bilateral', 'along', 'shift', 'destination', 'told', 'march', 'reconsidering', 'continued', 'ensures']",Neutral

The political secretary to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, who is a Penang-born and based leader thinks that now is the time to seek a higher post.

The 49-year-old, who hails from a prominent family in Penang, is now the Bayan Baru MP and successfully retained his Bayan Baru division post.

The national leadership elections for PKR is slated for next month.

In a social media post, the former deputy agriculture and agro-based industry minister explained that he began his involvement in PKR since he was a student at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia.

Likening himself to the reform generation of Selangor Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Amirudin Shari and Penang PKR liaison chairman Nurul Izzah Anwar, Sim said that he brings experience and vision to take the party forward.

He joins a crowded field vying for the number three position in PKR with Izzah also slated to defend her post, having won the Permatang Pauh division head post unopposed recently.

Entrepreneur Development and Cooperatives Deputy Minister Datuk Seri R Ramanan is also seeking for a post as vice-president.

PETALING JAYA:

Malaysian consumer spending is expected to remain strong in 2025 underpinned by a low inflationary environment and a stable labour market, says a Fitch Solutions unit.

In a report, BMI Country Risk & Industry Research (BMI) said a strong Malaysian labour market and easing inflation are raising wages in real terms, which has filtered into the disposable incomes of Malaysian households.

BMI said Malaysians’ earnings would grow by an average of 3.3% year-on-year, and the average Malaysian household would have a purchasing power about 8% higher than the 2019 level, with a continuously improving trajectory over the medium term to 2029.

“Overall, we forecast household spending to grow by 5.2% y-o-y over 2025, in real terms, to a value of RM943.7 billion, up from RM896.9 billion in 2024,” it said.

“As a result, household spending has returned to pre-Covid levels of growth, where it grew at a real average rate of 5.2% y-o-y during the 2015-2019 period.”

BMI also noted that inflation is forecast to average 2.4% in 2025, which remains low enough to support household purchasing power.

It also pointed out that the unemployment rate in Malaysia remained stable at a multi-year low of 3.1% in February, underpinning consumer confidence.

BMI forecast unemployment to average 3.1% for the year, supported by foreign investment and tourism.

However, BMI said consumer spending would continue to be restrained by Malaysian consumers’ high levels of indebtedness and the correspondingly high debt servicing costs.

It said high debt levels leave Malaysian households vulnerable to elevated interest rates, requiring consumers to allocate more of their budgets to debt repayments for longer and constraining their ability to spend on other goods and services.

It also forecast the ringgit to strengthen slightly against the US dollar from RM4.6 per US dollar last year to RM4.5 per US dollar this year.

Noting that the country remains heavily reliant on imports to meet local demand, it said that the strengthening of the exchange rate means that Malaysian consumers will benefit from cheaper imports.",1.74587E+12,en,0.233385027,2025-04-28 04:19:01,"['per', 'multiyear', 'supported', 'continuously', 'allocate', 'average', 'high', 'period', 'import', 'say', 'pointed', 'household', 'real', 'continue', 'vulnerable', 'disposable', 'market', 'raising', 'indebtedness', 'strong', 'dollar', 'bmi', 'yoy', 'expected', 'earnings', 'budget', 'requiring', 'fitch', 'investment', 'last', 'year', 'debt', 'grow', 'term', 'yearonyear', 'value', 'longer', 'strengthening', 'repayment', 'malaysian', 'advertisement', 'inflationary', 'power', 'constraining', 'also', 'exchange', 'good', 'elevated', 'remained', 'inflation', 'remains', 'trajectory', 'stable', 'grew', 'ringgit', 'mean', 'spending', 'medium', 'benefit', 'spend', 'labour', 'petaling', 'wage', 'returned', 'improving', 'sponsored', 'correspondingly', 'forecast', 'however', 'income', 'restrained', 'unit', 'filtered', 'confidence', 'support', 'noted', 'precovid', 'jaya', 'enough', 'cost', 'demand', 'leave', 'result', 'service', 'overall', 'higher', 'underpinned', 'country', 'strengthen', 'ability', 'easing', 'servicing', 'research', 'unemployment', 'tourism', 'report', 'growth', 'interest', 'low', 'would', 'remain', 'slightly', 'meet', 'solution', 'noting', 'cheaper', 'february', 'content', 'rate', 'foreign', 'environment', 'local', 'heavily', 'reliant', 'industry', 'malaysia', 'said', 'purchasing', 'level', 'billion', 'risk', 'underpinning', 'consumer']",Neutral

World Malaria Day 2025 will be marked with the theme “Malaria ends with us: Reinvest, Reimagine, Reignite”, aiming to re-energize efforts at all levels, from global policy to community action, to accelerate progress towards malaria elimination.

The Western Pacific faces challenges on the road to malaria elimination. In particular, the epidemiology of malaria exhibits enormous diversity, with the disease often concentrated in remote areas and/or among highly mobile or hard-to-reach populations, including forest goers, migrants, indigenous people, military and refugees.

Other key challenges in the Region include reaching remote populations in Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands, preventing relapse of vivax malaria through compliant full-course treatment, and halting transmission of knowlesi zoonotic malaria in Malaysia.

Reaching these populations with malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment is a critical strategy for achieving global malaria targets and delivering on the promise of “zero malaria.” WHO is working with countries and areas in the Region to develop and implement intensification strategies, such as targeted drug administration, fever screening and treatment, and rapid response to all malaria cases.

Malaria vaccines are a breakthrough for child health and malaria control. Two safe and effective vaccines are recommended by WHO: RTS,S and R21. These vaccines are now available and being used in 19 countries in Africa. WHO is committed to working with countries and partners to support the rollout of malaria vaccines so more at-risk populations can benefit from this additional malaria prevention as rapidly as possible.

Malaria success in the Western Pacific

While much work still needs to be done to reach “zero malaria”, the Region has had great success at controlling the disease. In 2000-2023, malaria case incidence reduced from 4.1 to 2.3 cases per 1000 population at risk and the malaria mortality rate reduced from 1.0 to 0.4 deaths per 100 000 population at risk. Papua New Guinea accounted for 87.5% of all cases in the Region in 2023, followed by Solomon Islands, the Philippines, and Cambodia.

China was certified malaria free in 2021. Malaysia has had no cases of human malaria for six consecutive years. Five countries – Cambodia, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, the Republic of Korea, Vanuatu, and Viet Nam – had fewer than 10 000 estimated cases in 2023.

Political analyst Ibrahim Suffian stated that while PSM has been active for many years, its reach among working-class communities remains limited, particularly in areas like Tapah, where plantation workers form a significant voter base.

PSM also faces an uphill battle against the perceived stigma of socialist values.

""Although it has been around for a long while, PSM’s footprint in the grassroots has been somewhat limited among the working classes.

""In Tapah, these include plantation sector workers.

""At the same time, it suffers from the stigma among Malay voters who cannot accept the 'socialist' label,"" said Ibrahim.

This enduring stigma has prevented the party from gaining traction, especially among the Malay electorate, hindering its ability to expand beyond niche support.

In semi-rural areas like Ayer Kuning, party loyalty, political branding and historical affiliations often outweigh policy-driven considerations in voting patterns.

Despite PSM's people-first policies, smaller parties struggle to compete for voter attention.

This requires significant investment in field activities across diverse local populations and sustained publicity campaigns years before elections to achieve recognition.

Ibrahim suggested that Malaysian voters are less influenced by ideological debates, such as left versus right and more firmly aligned along lines of identity, particularly race and religion.

""Malaysian voters tend to vote for familiar parties and don’t really subscribe to the left vs right ideological dimensions that are prevalent in the west.

""In Malaysia, the usual axis of political affiliation remains affixed on identity (race and religion).

""Most parties, such as BN and PN, display varying degrees of appeals to identity politics and both generally push out populist economic messages and policies. This makes it hard for PSM to find space for its messages,"" he said.

The dominance of identity-based politics continues to overshadow policy-driven platforms, leaving limited room for parties that do not engage in similar strategies.

Looking ahead, Ibrahim believes it will be difficult for PSM to significantly shift Malaysia's political landscape under current conditions.

""It’s hard to imagine a future when the political discourse in the country in the near future remains wedded to identity politics and the degree to which religion plays a role in public policy.

""Most parties here also advance populist agendas and PSM is not differentiated enough to provide a strong argument,"" he said.

He suggested that PSM could have a more meaningful impact by shifting its focus.

""It should continue to act as a pressure group to expand democratic space such as introducing local elections where it can capitalise on its local strengths,"" he added.

The Deputy Prime Minister said these reservoirs would store large volumes of rainwater and serve as a vital water source during dry seasons.

“The reservoirs will enable us to reserve water for use during droughts, ensuring a stable supply.

“The stored water can then be treated and distributed for various needs, whether for drinking, agriculture, industry or other uses.

“This is one of the strategies we are implementing,” he said at a dinner with Malaysians in the United Kingdom at the Malaysian High Commission here on Friday, Bernama reported.

It was attended by about 80 people, including students, employees of government-linked companies and staff of the Malaysian High Commission.

Also present were Malaysian High Commissioner to the UK and Northern Ireland Datuk Zakri Jaafar, Tenaga Nasional Bhd chief new energy officer Mohd Zarihi Mohd Hashim, Sarawak Energy Bhd group chief executive officer Datuk Sharbini Suhaili and a delegation from the Energy Transition and Water Transformation Ministry.

Fadillah, who is also Energy Transition and Water Transformation Minister, arrived here from Turkiye on Wednesday for a three-day working visit.

Earlier, he performed Friday prayers with the Malaysian Muslim community at the Malaysia Hall.

During the visit, Fadillah led the Malaysian delegation to the Summit on the Future of Energy Security held at Lancaster House, which was held for two days, starting Friday.

Elaborating, Fadillah said flood mitigation efforts must be carried out urgently as significant climate change is affecting Malaysia’s weather patterns, leading to various natural disasters, including floods caused by intense rainfall.

“Our focus now is on mitigating floods due to climate change.

“Thunderstorms, strong winds and extreme weather now result in a day’s rainfall, equaling what used to fall in a month.

“Places that have never experienced floods before are now inundated,” he added.

Fadillah stressed the need to minimise the impact of floods on the people and the country, noting the heavy financial losses incurred.

PETALING JAYA : The Malaysian solar industry will not be affected by the latest US tariffs on solar panels made in Southeast Asia, says an industry group.

The factories in Malaysia that are affected by US tariffs and duties are mostly Chinese-owned, with the panels built specifically for the US market, says Davis Chong, president of the Malaysian Photovoltaic Industry Association.

“They don’t sell their panels in Malaysia; instead, they ship everything to the US,” he told FMT.

He said Malaysian firms usually buy panels directly from China, where the prices are lower due to oversupply. “So it’s business as usual for our Malaysian companies. There will be no impact at all,” he said.

However, Chong said that previous rounds of US tariffs had “killed off” solar manufacturing in Malaysia, which is largely dominated by Chinese firms.

Chong said the higher costs and thin profit margins have made it unfeasible for Chinese manufacturers to continue operating in Malaysia, and their winding down could lead to more than 5,000 assembly line staff, engineers, and warehouse personnel retrenched.

The US imposed a blanket tariff of 9% on solar cell imports from Malaysia on Oct 1 last year, with five companies hit with duties ranging between 3.4% and 123.94%.

This included two Chinese-backed firms which manufacture in Malaysia: JinkoSolar Holding Co Ltd (3.47%) and Baojia New Energy (123.94%).

Earlier, Chinese-backed manufacturers like Longi, Risen Energy and JA Solar had already stopped expansion or cut back on production in Malaysia.

“We believe these manufacturing factories have been shutting down in the region and gradually relocating to non-Southeast Asia countries,” said Chong.

“Hence, the additional US duties will have no further impact on Malaysia’s solar manufacturing industry.”

On Monday, the US imposed new import duties on solar panels from Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand after claiming that certain companies had gained from Chinese subsidies and engaged in unfair pricing practices.

Cambodian companies faced duties of up to 3,521%, Vietnam 395.9%, Thailand 375.2%, while Malaysia saw a countrywide rate of 34.4%.

Malaysia exported RM37 billion worth of solar products in 2024, with RM12.5 billion (33.4%) going to the US.",1.74578E+12,en,-0.414281428,2025-04-27 00:30:33,"['lead', 'certain', 'staff', 'manufacture', 'hit', 'cut', 'ship', 'china', 'monday', 'assembly', 'instead', 'southeast', 'mostly', 'import', 'say', 'cambodian', 'export', 'continue', 'cell', 'thin', 'market', 'trade', 'sell', 'dont', 'pricing', 'fmt', 'going', 'energy', 'engaged', 'firm', 'factory', 'already', 'last', 'unfair', 'baojia', 'year', 'worth', 'included', 'nonsoutheast', 'element', 'malaysian', 'asia', 'could', 'thailand', 'shutting', 'unfeasible', 'winding', 'additional', 'claiming', 'duty', 'buy', 'production', 'hence', 'oct', 'business', 'margin', 'group', 'operating', 'chinese', 'panel', 'association', 'latest', 'earlier', 'saw', 'faced', 'chinesebacked', 'petaling', 'warehouse', 'personnel', 'impact', 'believe', 'expansion', 'two', 'everything', 'davis', 'risen', 'countrywide', 'envato', 'previous', 'lower', 'however', 'profit', 'product', 'chong', 'tariff', 'longi', 'ranging', 'specifically', 'region', 'exported', 'round', 'jaya', 'cost', 'manufacturing', 'manufacturer', 'higher', 'price', 'country', 'blanket', 'photovoltaic', 'killed', 'ltd', 'pic', 'oversupply', 'vietnam', 'dominated', 'company', 'made', 'five', 'built', 'imposed', 'directly', 'rate', 'practice', 'largely', 'jinkosolar', 'subsidy', 'chineseowned', 'affected', 'line', 'due', 'industry', 'stopped', 'usual', 'malaysia', 'back', 'president', 'said', 'engineer', 'cambodia', 'billion', 'holding', 'relocating', 'gained', 'solar', 'new', 'retrenched', 'usually', 'told', 'gradually', 'like']",Neutral

Sound familiar?

In the midst of all that hustle, stress and burnout creep in quietly, often dismissed as just part of the job. In most Malaysian workplaces, mental health is still seen as a personal issue rather than an organisational responsibility, says mental health expert, Prof Dr Andrew Mohanraj, President of the Malaysian Mental Health Association.

He emphasised the fact that prevention is rarely taken into account when it comes to crisis management at work, and that people react to illnesses rather than addressing the root causes.

Concerned about what more could be done, he highlighted the role of the organisational level of companies, needing to shift ""from being reactive to being proactive.""

""There is a need to embrace mental health into core HR policies—not as an afterthought, but as a business priority. Regular well-being audits, just like financial ones, should be conducted to assess stress levels, workload equity, and psychological safety,"" he said.

He added that mental health literacy for all staff is important—from interns to CEOs—in order to understand the early signs of stress and how to seek help.

We spend a large part of our lives at work, making it a possible source of chronic stress, quietly eroding not just our mental health but also our physical health, he said.

Prof Dr Andrew Mohanraj, President of the Malaysian Mental Health Association and consultant psychiatrist.

""In Malaysia, where working long hours and juggling multiple responsibilities is often seen as a badge of honour, many may not realise when stress crosses the line from 'just part of the job' to something more dangerous,"" he said.

Iterating that common sources of stress at work include unrealistic deadlines, lack of support, poor communication, and job insecurity, he said that our bodies would default to staying in 'fight or flight' mode.

""Over time, this continuous activation of the stress response wears us down,"" he said.

He added that physical impacts include high blood pressure, heart disease, weakened immune system, tension headaches, migraines, poor sleep, and fatigue.

For the mental aspect, it could contribute to burnout, anxiety and depression, irritability, mood swings, difficulty concentrating, and reduced motivation and job satisfaction, he said, adding that people should look out for early warning signs.

""Early warning signs to watch for include feeling exhausted even after a full night's sleep, increased absenteeism or frequent minor illnesses, and trouble focusing or making decisions,"" he said.

""Watch also for changes in appetite or weight, withdrawing from colleagues or social activities, and a constant sense of dread about work,"" he added.

TOXIC WORKPLACE CULTURE

Andrew emphasised the importance of watching out for toxic workplace culture, which may not only include unrealistic workload, but also glorifying overworking and seeing taking leave as a sign of weakness. Employers also tend to micromanage, apply rigid rules, and not trust employees to make decisions.

As a result, it could lead to exhaustion, burnout, feelings of helplessness, and frustration—all of which could lead to the deterioration of both mental and physical health.

""Employees are expected to be available at all times, even after hours, and these patterns fuel chronic stress and burnout—though the patterns have been accepted as 'normal', becoming damaging over time,"" he said.

""Autonomy is essential for motivation and job satisfaction.

""Tight deadlines, ever-growing task lists, and unclear expectations can make employees feel like they are never good enough, fuelling anxiety and reducing self-worth,"" Andrew said.



He also highlighted that managers should be approachable, not dismissive of concerns, and offer guidance to avoid the culture of silence at the workplace, which could make employees in such environments feel isolated and unsupported.

Furthermore, a toxic workplace would endorse toxic competition and blame culture, which encourages employees to pit against each other and practise punishing mistakes without allowing room for learning—this, in return, increases stress and lowers morale.

Not only does it lead to work feeling undervalued and disconnected from a larger purpose, it could further lead to disengagement and emotional exhaustion, the psychiatrist said.





Chronic stress and exhaustion may be more than just part of the job—it could be your workplace environment. Here's what an expert has to say.

WHAT CAN BE DONE

Andrew said that deeper, structural changes are needed—beyond offering mental health days, flexible hours, and employee assistance programmes.

""If companies want to truly reduce workplace stress and promote well-being, they must go beyond surface-level perks,"" he said.

""Employees should feel safe to speak up, raise concerns, or admit they are struggling without fear of judgment or consequences,"" he said, adding that it starts with empathetic leadership and open-door communication.

""Supervisors and team leaders need training—not just in KPIs and performance reviews, but also in emotional intelligence and how to support staff through tough times,"" he added.

Andrew highlighted that enforcing reasonable working hours, limiting after-hours communication, and making it clear that rest is valued and not penalised are among the ways to help lift the burden of employees going to work every day.

""Flexible schedules help, but they must be accompanied by a culture that respects boundaries—by encouraging work-life balance and meaning it,"" he said.

He emphasised that jobs should be structured in a way that offers purpose, clarity, and achievable goals—where regular check-ins could help redistribute workloads and prevent chronic overwhelm.

Upon addressing outreach that could be done, he said that mental health professionals should be brought in for workshops, creating peer support groups, and providing stress management resources.

""Measure what matters—not just by tracking productivity or profit, but by tracking engagement, well-being, absenteeism, and staff retention. These are key indicators of a healthy workforce,"" he said in an interview with Sinar Daily.

MENTAL HEALTH: TABOO?

Andrew urged for national guidelines on psychosocial risk management, backed by enforcement, to combat the issue being perceived as a taboo—further standardising best practices across industries to enhance the people’s mental health.

He also highlighted the need for incentives for companies that prioritise employee mental health, such as tax reliefs or public recognition, which could drive cultural change and bring the structural transformation needed for improved well-being from both the mental and physical aspects.

""It is important to integrate mental health into occupational health regulations, ensuring that stress-related illnesses are acknowledged and covered just like physical injuries,"" he added.

Looking ahead, he said that Malaysia has made a fair share of strides in mental health awareness—only lacking in the context of the workplace. ""There is still a gap between intention and action,"" he said.

""The future of work must be built not just on productivity but on people—on their health, dignity, and right to thrive.""",1.74578E+12,en,-0.645720899,2025-04-27 01:00:00,"['rule', 'beyond', 'swing',

As players and officials of the participating teams were eligible for free accommodation and meals during their stay for the event in Johor Bahru, then PHF president retired Brig Khalid Sajjad Khokhar with his close relatives and friends — five persons — also went to Malaysia to witness the matches. But the organisers had not included them in the list of persons who had been invited.

A letter written on Feb 27, 2025, a copy of which is available with Dawn, was received at the PHF but addressed to the junior team’s manager, sought a deposit of 45,770 Malaysian ringgit ($10,349.35) for the hotel stay and meals.

When contacted, PHF secretary Rana Mujahid confirmed that the letter was received and added that the same had been forwarded to the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) citing all the expenditures of the said tour were borne by them.

Asked if the payment of $10,349.35 was not the bone of contention that denied Pakistan an invitation to participate in this year’s Sultan Azlan Shah Cup, Mujahid dispelled the impression saying that Azlan Shah Cup’s organisers and Johor Hockey Association were different identities.

“The Malaysian Hockey Federation has also not invited Japan this time, which has no case of default. In fact, Malaysians had sought higher-ranked teams this year and unfortunately [currently] Pakistan is not included among world’s top teams,” the PHF secretary said when contacted by Dawn.

According to a letter, then acting PHF secretary general Shahid Parvez Bhandara had requested the PSB to organise a camp for the Azlan Shah Cup and also demanded TA/DA, food and accommodation for the camp.

Meanwhile, it is learnt that Brig Khokhar during the 2023 event went to Malaysia with some family members and PHF officials. The visit was not compulsory, particularly if he was not invited.

“I don’t know if the PHF president was invited by the organisers but yes we received a letter and it was forwarded to the PSB,” the PHF secretary said.

It may be mentioned here that the PHF due to the country’s unprecedented decline in international hockey and corruption scandals from 2008 to 2022 is already facing severe criticism by several former Olympians and hockey lovers.

The Auditor General of Pakistan had included 113 paras as objections in its audit reports for the 2008-2022 period and the cases in this regard had been handed over to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA). However, it seems that the FIA for several years has been working at a snail’s pace in all cases.

For 2025, the theme is “Malaria Ends with Us: Reinvest, Reimagine, Reignite”, calling for renewed global commitment and innovation in the fight to eliminate malaria.

While significant progress has been made, challenges such as drug resistance, climate change and zoonotic malaria continue to threaten malaria control efforts.

To achieve a malaria-free future, there is an urgent need to reinvest in research and healthcare, reimagine new solutions, and reignite a global commitment to reduce the burden of this disease worldwide.

From macaques to humans

Zoonotic malaria, primarily caused by the parasite Plasmodium knowlesi, is transmitted to humans when an Anopheles mosquito feeds on infected macaques and subsequently bites a human.

It represents a significant challenge because zoonotic malaria introduces a new dynamic in malaria transmission, where the primary host is not human, but wildlife, making it more difficult to control and predict.

Countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand have seen an increase in P. knowlesi malaria cases, often in forested areas where humans and macaques share habitats.

The rise in zoonotic malaria has been linked to factors such as deforestation, land-use changes, and the expansion of human settlements into previously untouched wildlife areas.

These environmental changes facilitate closer contact between humans, mosquitoes and macaques, increasing the likelihood of zoonotic transmission.

As such, this form of malaria presents a unique public health challenge that requires a broader focus on environmental health and wildlife conservation.

In Malaysia

Malaysia has made remarkable progress in the fight against malaria, particularly with the successful eradication of indigenous human malaria since 2018.

The country has significantly reduced malaria transmission, largely due to improved public health measures, widespread use of insecticide-treated bed nets, indoor residual spraying and effective antimalarial treatments.

However, the rise of zoonotic malaria is increasingly challenging this success.

This shift highlights the complex nature of malaria transmission and the evolving landscape of the disease in Malaysia.

The rise in P. knowlesi malaria has been particularly pronounced in East Malaysia, where the infection is closely linked to deforestation, agricultural expansion and human encroachment into macaque habitats.

The close proximity of humans to macaques and their shared environments has significantly increased the risk of zoonotic transmission.

P. knowlesi, which naturally infects macaques, is now the dominant malaria species in this region.

Several states in Peninsular Malaysia, such as Kelantan, have also reported an increasing number of zoonotic malaria cases, particularly in rural areas.

While P. knowlesi remains the primary zoonotic malaria parasite of concern in Malaysia, the emergence of other zoonotic malaria species, such as Plasmodium cynomolgi and Plasmodium inui in humans, has added a new dimension of complexity to the country’s malaria elimination efforts.

Influencing factors

The factors contributing to the increase in zoonotic malaria are complex and multifactorial, encompassing environmental, ecological, socioeconomic and behavioural elements.

One of the most significant factors contributing to the rise of zoonotic malaria is deforestation and human encroachment into wildlife habitats.

As human populations expand and agricultural activities increase, forests are being cleared for farming, logging and infrastructure development.

This land-use change brings humans into closer proximity with macaques, increasing the likelihood of zoonotic spillover.

Climate change also plays a critical role in shaping the spread of zoonotic malaria.

Temperature, rainfall patterns and humidity affect the lifecycle and distribution of both mosquitoes and the Plasmodium parasite.

Rising temperatures and unpredictable rainfall patterns can expand the geographical range of Anopheles mosquitoes, bringing them into new areas where malaria was not previously a concern.

Additionally, climate change can alter macaque behaviour and migration patterns, pushing these animals into new areas where they come into contact with human populations and increasing the risk of zoonotic transmission, especially with the presence of Anopheles mosquitoes in these areas.

While traditional vector control measures such as insecticide-treated nets, indoor residual spraying and larval source management have been effective in controlling human malaria, they may be less effective against zoonotic malaria.

This is mainly because the primary mosquito vectors are outdoor biters (exophagic) and typically feed outside human dwellings.

As a result, indoor-based strategies like insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying, offer limited protection against these vectors.

Preventive methods

Preventing zoonotic malaria requires proactive measures to reduce exposure to infected mosquitoes and macaques in areas where the disease is prevalent.

Many ecotourism activities, such as hiking and wildlife observation, take place in forested or jungle areas that can be high-risk zones for zoonotic malaria transmission.

One of the most effective ways to prevent such infections is to avoid entering forested areas, especially during the peak mosquito-biting times, which are typically at dawn and dusk.

If entering such areas is unavoidable, it is crucial to take the necessary precautions, such as taking prophylactic drugs.

Wearing the right protective clothing is also a simple, yet highly effective measure against mosquito bites.

When entering a jungle where zoonotic malaria is a risk, it is important to wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants and socks to minimise exposed skin.

Light-coloured clothing is also recommended, as mosquitoes are generally more attracted to dark colours.

Clothing made from tightly woven fabrics provides an added barrier against mosquito bites, further reducing the risk of infection.

In addition, using insect ­repellents containing DEET or picaridin can significantly reduce the chances of mosquito bites.

These repellents should be applied to exposed skin, ­especially when hiking or ­engaging in other outdoor ­activities in areas with a high risk of zoonotic malaria.

It is also advisable to treat clothing and gear with insect repellent to provide additional protection.

If someone develops a fever, chills, headache or other ­symptoms resembling malaria after engaging in jungle-related activities or visiting areas where zoonotic malaria is known to occur, it is crucial to seek medical attention immediately.

Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are vital in preventing the progression of the disease to more severe forms.

Stronger multi-sectoral collaborations in combating zoonotic malaria through the integration of the One Health approach are also vital.

This includes strengthening surveillance and diagnostic capabilities in the human health sector, monitoring infection in macaque populations and implementing targeted vector control strategies.

Environmental management, such as reducing deforestation and limiting human-wildlife ­contact, also plays a key role.

By fostering collaboration among public health, veterinary and environmental agencies, the One Health approach offers a comprehensive and sustainable solution to reduce the risk of transmission and support ­long-term control of zoonotic malaria.

They help them get into research, upskill for jobs

NEW DELHI: ""I did around 20 National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL) courses during my BTech at Sathyabama University,"" said Rizwan Ahmed Nijamudeen, who graduated last year with a BTech in biotechnology. The courses were instrumental in helping him secure a pre-doctoral fellowship at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur’s School of Medical Science and Technology.

The fellowship lasts one year and so Nijamudeen aimed for a full-fledged postgraduate programme to join after. Very recently, he received an offer for a master’s in biotechnology from the University of Malaya, Malaysia. “The fellowship is for one year and so, I secured my seat in Malaysia,” he said.

The NPTEL was launched and is managed by IIT Madras.

Like him, Renuka Igade also found value in online learning. A BTech graduate in computer science and engineering from NK Orchid College of Engineering and Technology, Solapur, Maharashtra, Igade had taken five courses on the Internet of Things (IoT).

""I did this course because I felt it would help me in my research work later,"" she said. Igade is also a fellow, in IIT Kharagpur’s Department of Agriculture and Food Engineering.

Having completed five courses in a semester, both Nizamudeen and Igade were “NPTEL stars” – a fact that gave them a distinct advantage in fellowship admissions. However, completing a variety of online courses is now integral to BTech student life. They not only support the regular curriculum but give them an edge in placements.

BTech and online courses: The rush

According to Andrews Samraj, a professor at Chikka Muniyappa Reddy (CMR) University, students are rushing to join short-term online courses as they want to enhance their on-demand skills. They want to enhance their skills in areas like Java, Python, artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, and multimedia. Courses that include an internship or a capstone project are more attractive as they afford hands-on practical experience.

Yogesh, who goes by a single name, is in third-year of BTech at CMR University and has done courses in Java and data structures and algorithms from Simplilearn. “It helped me to build problem-solving skills, how to process work at the back end,” he said.

Samraj has observed that third-year students are especially eager. “Their ultimate goal is to land their dream job, and they are willing to undergo all kinds of training and certification that can help them achieve it. Students show a much higher interest if the course is closely linked to innovation and placements,” said Samraj. Placements consume much of their time and energy in the fourth year.

IIT Kharagpur professor Haimanti Banerjee pointed out that higher education regulators, All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and University Grants Commission (UGC) have allowed as much as 40% of the course credits to be obtained through online courses. That and the push for online learning has meant that students now have access to high-quality classes taught by IIT and Indian Institute of Science (IISc) faculty members.

“Although the NPTEL courses are free to access, students who wish to transfer credits need to pay about Rs. 1,000 to appear for a certification exam,” Banerjee said.

She also said courses like cloud computing, programming in Java, introduction to the internet of things (IoT), and Python for data science are especially popular among BTech students. “Cloud computing continues to be the top choice because it is so closely linked to industry needs. Students who complete these courses and earn certificates improve their job prospects considerably because the certificates are issued by IIT faculty, which adds strong credibility.”

Support from universities

Dipak Sinha, professor at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Jain Deemed to be University, said that students prefer short-term online courses that offer genuine certification and can be linked to their Academic Bank of Credits. Platforms like NPTEL, SWAYAM, Coursera, and other MOOCs are highly popular for this reason.

Jain offers a structured system to encourage students to take online courses. The university has signed an agreement with Coursera, allowing students to integrate online learning with their regular studies. Faculty members select Coursera courses that match around 70-80% of the university syllabus. Students are then assigned these courses as part of their regular assessments.

Sinha listed much the same courses that other academics did. The most popular courses have to do with AI, data sciences, blockchain and allied fields.

“They choose these subjects because they are closely linked to job market demands. Recruiters today are more concerned about a student’s actual skills and knowledge rather than what is formally covered in their syllabus,” he said. “Besides technical subjects, there is also a growing interest in data analytics, Power BI, Tableau, advanced Excel, and data visualisation. Students know that these skills can boost their employability and help them perform better during placement interviews.”

Online courses: A trend

According to Banerjee, it is not just students who are taking advantage of short-term online courses. Faculty members and industry professionals are also enrolling to upgrade their skills and stay abreast of new technologies.

Last year, NPTEL enrolled around 36 lakh students. The courses come in 12, eight and four-week formats.

“Each lecture lasts about 30 minutes, making it easier for students to stay focused. Around eight lakh students registered for certification exams last year. NPTEL also makes it easy for students to find exam centres by setting up a centre wherever at least 200 students register,” Banerjee further added.",1.74578E+12,en,0.479691893,2025-04-27 07:34:29,"['online', 'nptel', 'highly', 'semester', 'bank', 'indian', 'banerjee', 'appear', 'pointed', 'btech', 'india', 'syllabus', 'muniyappa', 'cmr', 'market', 'kharagpur', 'madras', 'consume', 'besides', 'certification', 'attractive', 'taken', 'aimed', 'concerned', 'value', 'council', 'integrate', 'protocol', 'complete', 'structured', 'lakh', 'fourweek', 'power', 'admission', 'assigned', 'nijamudeen', 'edge', 'sinha', 'trend', 'experience', 'genuine', 'setting', 'regular', 'problemsolving', 'credibility', 'focused', 'excel', 'choose', 'soft', 'secure', 'commission', 'professor', 'rather', 'earning', 'agreement', 'postnep', 'name', 'allied', 'reddy', 'achieve', 'perform', 'simplilearn', 'curriculum', 'professional', 'ugc', 'enrolling', 'wish', 'research', 'digital', 'minute', 'national', 'ahmed', 'considerably', 'interest', 'ondemand', 'according', 'encourage', 'give', 'moocs', 'growing', 'variety', 'regulator', 'managed', 'take', 'goal', 'top', 'completing', 'much', 'grant', 'industry', 'land', 'malaysia', 'rush', 'yogesh', 'integral', 'programming', 'instrumental', 'along', 'registered', 'lecture', 'time', 'felt', 'allowing', 'class', 'shortterm', 'security', 'include', 'single', 'strong', 'social', 'format', 'abreast', 'mba', 'closely', 'ready', 'secured', 'rizwan', 'enrolled', 'prospect', 'boost', 'programme', 'allowed', 'transformation', 'covered', 'listed', 'taking', 'sitharam', 'transfer', 'show', 'recently', 'recruiter', 'block', 'easy', 'earn', 'make', 'principal', 'platform', 'graduated', 'swayam', 'biotechnology', 'advanced', 'actual', 'andrew', 'dean', 'get', 'fullfledged', 'observed', 'interview', 'read', 'postgraduate', 'education', 'employability', 'degree', 'star', 'sathyabama', 'access', 'undergo', 'introduction', 'technical', 'integration', 'engineering', 'aicte', 'distinct', 'capstone', 'help', 'predoctoral', 'add', 'system', 'want', 'renuka', 'rushing', 'phd', 'algorithm', 'find', 'fellow', 'skill', 'eight', 'data', 'stay', 'back', 'obtained', 'training', 'project', 'choice', 'analysis', 'driving', 'build', 'dipak', 'internship', 'iit', 'solapur', 'agriculture', 'machine', 'taught', 'chain', 'energy', 'completed', 'offer', 'kind', 'expertise', 'samraj', 'last', 'course', 'highquality', 'member', 'register', 'come', 'computing', 'university', 'upskill', 'pay', 'bitsom', 'improve', 'student', 'academic', 'end', 'marketing', 'one', 'launched', 'dream', 'today', 'know', 'blockchain', 'thirdyear', 'free', 'technology', 'iits', 'formally', 'centre', 'wherever', 'eager', 'however', 'joint', 'certificate', 'least', 'kharagpurs', 'exam', 'among', 'support', 'pursue', 'demand', 'done', 'higher', 'need', 'deemed', 'delhi', 'ultimate', 'strengthen', 'subject', 'thing', 'meant', 'fourth', 'five', 'study', 'haimanti', 'issued', 'artificial', 'school', 'linked', 'match', 'department', 'many', 'making', 'new', 'process', 'python', 'better', 'winwin', 'nizamudeen', 'biggest', 'later', 'java', 'igade', 'knowledge', 'helping', 'work', 'found', 'handson', 'join', 'around', 'medical', 'credit', 'popular', 'upgrade', 'seat', 'enhance', 'chikka', 'plan', 'food', 'year', 'added', 'iisc', 'college', 'placement', 'learning', 'also', 'tableau', 'nanotechnology', 'faculty', 'area', 'management', 'enhanced', 'continues', 'science', 'push', 'especially', 'although', 'orchid', 'medium', 'institute', 'cyber', 'chairman', 'select', 'master', 'maharashtra', 'see', 'helped', 'life', 'internet', 'prefer', 'coursera', 'graduate', 'job', 'environmental', 'easier', 'assessment', 'advantage', 'afford', 'innovation', 'multimedia', 'practical', 'willing', 'field', 'fact', 'cloud', 'intelligence', 'would', 'received', 'jain', 'fellowship', 'part', 'gave', 'foreign', 'analytics', 'iot', 'structure', 'said', 'visualisation', 'malaya', 'signed', 'computer', 'reason', 'like']",Neutral

The 23-year-old grew up in Emu Plains, before moving to the US through the ProKick Australia program, which landed him at the University of Florida and the Gators.

Like many Aussies before him, Crawshaw was drafted as punter. Earlier ranked by draft analyst Dane Brugler as the top punter available, Crawshaw was the first punter selected in the draft.

""Played a lot of sports as a kid ... rugby was the main one,'' Crawshaw told media after his selection.

""Pretty much started looking for something to do after school, play some sports ... they gave me a scholarship to come over to Florida and spent five years here, and (now) lucky enough to move on and be with the Denver Broncos.""

In his last four years at Florida, Crawshaw averaged 44.1, 47.9, 48.9 and 45.7 yards per punt. He will officially compete with veteran Matt Haack for the Broncos' punter job.

""Matt Haack has already been in the league for a long time, and I've watched a lot of film on him,'' Crawshaw said.

""I'm kind of just looking forward to competing.""

His drafting caps off a brilliant few weeks for Crawshaw, who last month got engaged to his long-term girlfriend.

Crawshaw's pre-draft scouting report boasted of a potential ""decade-plus career as a reliable NFL punter with Pro Bowl potential"".

""Crawshaw will likely move in and become an immediate NFL starter with the potential to become a genuine field-position weapon,"" it read.

""His combination of power, touch, and directional control makes him an ideal fit for teams emphasising special teams play. The Australian's background actually works in his favor, bringing a different perspective to directional punting and spin control.

""His skill set particularly suits teams playing in outdoor stadiums where wind and weather management become crucial factors. The ability to execute multiple punt styles - from traditional bombs to rugby-style rollers - gives coordinators a versatile weapon for any situation.

""Crawshaw's experience holding on placekicks adds valuable roster flexibility.""

Elsewhere, Shedeur Sanders’ long wait has finally ended.

The Cleveland Browns selected the Colorado quarterback and son of Hall of Famer Deion Sanders in the fifth round with the 144th overall pick.

That ended a stunning fall for Sanders, the most recognisable player in this draft class after his attention-getting college career.

Draft forecasts generally rated Sanders behind only Miami’s Cam Ward — who went first overall to the Tennessee Titans — among quarterbacks in this class, but five quarterbacks were taken before him instead, with one of them going to Cleveland when the Browns picked Oregon’s Dillon Gabriel in the third round.

After such a long delay, Sanders let out his emotions once he finally got the call a couple of days later than expected.

With his brother Shilo live-streaming the proceedings on Twitch, Sanders could be seen putting on a Browns cap and performing a celebratory dance at his family's Texas home. Another video shared on X by the NFL showed Sanders jumping into a swimming pool.

In a plot twist that feels straight out of a tech-dystopian fever dream, teachers at a rural school have discovered their own version of the town square – except it’s just a concrete pillar with mysteriously perfect cell reception.

At SK Padang Banggi in Kudat, Sabah, there’s precisely one spot where you can upload your lesson plans or send that urgent email without wanting to throw your phone across the corridor.

It’s not the teacher’s lounge or the computer lab, but a random sunshade pillar that has become the unofficial IT department of the entire school.

The situation is so absurd that teachers have installed a real phone tray on this beam.

Think of it as a shrine to Digi (their mobile carrier), whose name is literally scrawled on the pillar like some digital graffiti.

The message is clear: “Here Be Signal.”

One teacher’s video shows the whole bizarre ritual: place your phone on the makeshift altar, and boom – full 4G bars.

SIGNAL HUNTING: Where Education Meets Digital Hide and Seek

Move it an inch away? Digital wasteland. Try another pillar? Nothing.

It’s like finding the one spot at a coffee shop where the WiFi works, except this is where educators have to stand to do their actual jobs.

The teacher explains with what sounds like well-practised patience: “It’s our school’s unique feature.”

Translation: This is what they have to deal with every time they need to submit anything online.

Welcome to 2025, where finding a cell signal at a Malaysian school feels like a game of architectural Pokémon Go.

Just remember – you gotta catch it at the right pillar.

The case is also a reminder that some things haven’t changed in Sabah since Veveonah Mosibin’s viral 2020 camping atop a tree to access Wi-Fi to take her online exams.

Chief statistician Datuk Seri Dr Mohd Uzir Mahidin said the mining sector continued its downtrend in the year, with a double-digit decrease of 15.0% in March 2025, compared to a 9.7% fall in February 2025.

He said the decline was attributed to both the extraction of natural gas (-16.2%) and the extraction of crude petroleum (-14.5%) indices.

“The manufacturing sector also recorded a 1.8% decline (February 2025: -0.3%), with notable decreases in the manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products (-16.2%) and manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products (-5.1%).

“Similarly, the electricity and gas supply sector posted a 0.5% decrease (February 2025: -0.3%),” he said in a statement on Monday.

However, Mohd Uzir said the agriculture, forestry and fishing sector remained positive, up 9.9% (February 2025: 15.2%), driven by the growing of perennial crops sub-sector (16.9%).

He added that the water supply sector also registered a 0.7% increase in March 2025.

On a month-on-month basis, the chief statistician said PPI local production declined by 0.6% in March 2025, versus a 0.1% increase in the previous month.

He said the mining sector fell by 3.8% due to decreases in the extraction of natural gas (-5.7%) and the extraction of crude petroleum (-3.0%).

“The agriculture, forestry and fishing sector also decreased by 0.5%, dragged down by the fishing (-2.1%) and the growing of perennial crops (-0.4%) indices,” he said.

Meanwhile, Mohd Uzir said the manufacturing sector declined by 0.3%, attributed to the decline in the manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products (-0.5%).

The water supply sectors also recorded a marginal decline of 0.1%, while the electricity and gas supply increased by 0.3%, he said.

Looking at selected countries, Mohd Uzir said the United States’s PPI recorded a 2.7% increase and Japan’s a 4.2% expansion, while China’s posted a 2.5% decline and Thailand’s a 1.6% contraction.",1.74587E+12,en,-0.271278441,2025-04-28 09:04:44,"['crude', 'manufacture', 'sector', 'supply', 'china', 'monday', 'forestry', 'statistician', 'electronic', 'decreased', 'gas', 'seri', 'mohd', 'downtrend', 'agriculture', 'declined', 'mahidin', 'perennial', 'lumpur', 'doubledigit', 'index', 'month', 'year', 'driven', 'added', 'decrease', 'refined', 'optical', 'extraction', 'increase', 'thailand', 'also', 'remained', 'production', 'uzir', 'united', 'rise', 'similarly', 'datuk', 'meanwhile', 'mining', 'positive', 'fall', 'increased', 'expansion', 'coke', 'attributed', 'dragged', 'statess', 'fell', 'natural', 'previous', 'however', 'product', 'statement', 'versus', 'looking', 'decline', 'water', 'japan', 'manufacturing', 'price', 'monthonmonth', 'marginal', 'country', 'crop', 'mainly', 'posted', 'petroleum', 'subsector', 'electricity', 'contraction', 'according', 'compared', 'kuala', 'recorded', 'basis', 'february', 'growing', 'fishing', 'local', 'chief', 'due', 'eased', 'april', 'notable', 'department', 'malaysia', 'producer', 'said', 'ppi', 'selected', 'registered', 'statistic', 'march', 'computer', 'continued', 'dosm']",Neutral

He met Italy’s Deputy Enterprises Minister and Made in Italy Minister Valentino Valentini, at the Investment, Trade and Industry Ministry today.

“We would like to see stronger collaboration between Malaysia and Italy. And we also like to see a lot more collaboration between Asean and the EU,” he told reporters at the launch of Generali Malaysia’s new headquarters today.

Liew said strengthening economic ties between Malaysia and Italy, and between Asean and the EU, is very important.

Liew said meeting the Italy deputy minister was important, particularly in the current situation in which they are dealing with a “once-in-a-generation” challenge from US President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

On recent reports alleging that Chinese goods are being labelled as Malaysian to evade US tariffs, Liew said Malaysia has consistently maintained a firm stance against such practices. “We have always maintained that pass-through should not be allowed. We emphasise value-adding, we want to see value-added activities take place in Malaysia and export based on that.”

He added that the Malaysian government is safeguarding Malaysia’s trade reputation.

“If you Google my name you’ll see that I’ve always maintained this view that there shouldn’t be passing through.”

According to a Bloomberg report, some China-based freight brokers are allegedly rerouting products through Malaysia and falsely declaring them as Malaysian-made to exploit lower tariff rates.

One broker told Bloomberg that “most clients are opting to route Chinese merchandise through Malaysia and say it was made there” to avoid US tariffs as high as 145%.

Malaysia’s tariff rate stands at 24%, making it an attractive cover for goods that actually originate in China.

According to five merchants interviewed by Bloomberg, these offers have surged since Trump imposed steep tariffs on Chinese imports.

The brokers typically reach out on social media, offering to help reduce costs by faking shipment values or origins.

“We can provide the solution to help you save your cost,” read one such message from a logistics firm offering to serve as an importer and declare a lower value for a shipment.

Today, Generali Malaysia opened Menara Generali on Jalan Sultan Ismail in the heart of Kuala Lumpur, uniting its general and life insurance operations under one roof, enhancing collaboration and operational efficiency.

export,Nestle Malaysia Could Still Face Margin Pressures In Coming Quarters,1.74594E+12,businesstoday.com.my,www.businesstoday.com.my,https://news.google.com/read/CBMiswFBVV95cUxQLW5mYXNMRWxVeW1CMkRlb0IzTFRaMWZiTGhjM0xFa3VXOFhyWEN0VWVMSU5QS000R3BsSnFaX2haQURsTHNWUjBfd2NROGdTOEY2VFYtWFYybVpQdktfM09UWTVLVFdHdl9hMk5MTWNPNnNmdHFyR3NnNHJRbTk3YVFxZWg2aXByMktVenNLaS1mWnppMk9tX0d4X1hLb0ZkOHVHWnBUSlBja1BXUmpTU0hTSQ?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://www.businesstoday.com.my/2025/04/29/nestle-malaysia-could-still-face-margin-pressures-in-coming-quarters/,"MIDF Investment Bank Bhd (MIDF Research) has maintained a NEUTRAL call on Nestlé (Malaysia) Bhd with an unchanged target price (TP) of RM77.90. At the same time, CIMB Investment Bank Bhd (CIMB Securities) has reiterated a HOLD recommendation with a lower TP of RM86.20 from RM92.00. Hong Leong Investment Bank Bhd (HLIB) has upgraded its call to HOLD from Sell with an unchanged TP of RM78.00 following the company’s 1QFY25 results.

Nestlé posted a 1QFY25 revenue of RM1.77 billion, representing a marginal -0.8% year-on-year (YoY) decline but a strong 20.1% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) growth, driven by festive season demand during Chinese New Year and Ramadan. Core profit after tax and minority interest (PATAMI) fell -19.3% YoY to RM177.4 million but rebounded sharply by 430.9% QoQ. MIDF Research said the results were in line with expectations, accounting for 33% of its full-year forecast and 37% of consensus estimates, attributing the performance to seasonal factors. No dividend was declared for the quarter, which is consistent with Nestlé’s usual practice of paying dividends in subsequent quarters.

CIMB Securities also noted that the results were broadly within expectations, with 1Q typically being a seasonally stronger quarter. It pointed to a decline in domestic sales amid subdued consumer sentiment and ongoing boycott activities, while export sales rose 8.8% YoY. Gross profit margins contracted by 2.4 percentage points YoY to 31% due to elevated input costs, higher marketing expenses, and a shift towards a less profitable sales mix, leading to the weaker bottom line.

HLIB similarly reported that the results were broadly within expectations, citing a satisfactory showing despite challenges from softer domestic demand and elevated commodity prices. It added that export sales, which rose by 9% YoY, helped offset some of the weakness locally. Nestlé’s core PAT of RM172.2 million made up 39% of HLIB’s and 36% of consensus full-year estimates.

Looking ahead, MIDF Research remained cautious on Nestlé’s outlook, highlighting concerns over persistent weak consumer sentiment and geopolitical risks, which could continue to pressure margins. CIMB Securities forecast a 23.6% growth in FY25 core net profit, driven by a 7.9% increase in revenue, underpinned by an expected recovery in domestic demand and resilient export sales. It also flagged that margin pressures could persist due to high commodity prices but believed Nestlé’s pricing strategies and cost initiatives could help mitigate the impact.

HLIB pointed out that despite ceasefire talks in the Israel-Gaza conflict, the sales normalisation process could take time. It noted that Nestlé continues to push forward with its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives, such as expanding its Project SAVE waste collection programme and promoting the MILO Energy for Good initiative.

The state agriculture, agro-based industry and rural development committee chairman said this was according to figures released by the Malaysian Quarantine and Inspection Services Department (Maqis).

He said the export volume represented 6.8 million tonnes of agricultural products shipped through eight checkpoints across the state, making Johor the clear leader in agricultural trade.

“The Sultan Abu Bakar Complex (KSAB) in Iskandar Puteri contributed the lion’s share of this achievement, handling RM10.3bil worth of agricultural exports, equivalent to 3.49 million tonnes of goods.

“Johor’s strategic location near major regional markets such as Singapore and Indonesia has been a major factor behind its export success, with routes also extending further to China and the Middle East,” he said.

Zahari added that the state’s performance reflected its geographical advantage and strong agricultural production base.

“Our export strength is not just due to our proximity to international markets but is also supported by world class port facilities and Johor’s standing as Malaysia’s top producer of fruits, vegetables and livestock products,” he said.

He also said the state government was committed to further strengthening the sector by introducing new initiatives aimed at enhancing productivity and expanding export opportunities for local farmers and agro-entrepreneurs.

“I can assure you that we will fully leverage Johor’s natural advantages to empower our agricultural sector and contribute more significantly to the nation’s economy,” he added.

Zahari also said that he recently joined an agricultural export operation at the KSAB checkpoint, carried out by the Federal Agricultural Marketing Authority and Maqis.

Hannah Thomas, daughter of former Malaysia AG, taking on Australian PM in federal polls

PETALING JAYA - Ms Hannah Thomas, the daughter of former Malaysia attorney-general Tan Sri Tommy Thomas, is challenging Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in the Australian federal elections as The Greens candidate for the Grayndler constituency.

Grayndler is an electoral division in the Australian House of Representatives, located in the Inner West region of Sydney, New South Wales.

Ms Thomas, who is a lawyer, activist and advocate for progressive change, believes in fighting against genocide in Palestine, solving the housing and cost of living crisis and supporting the rights of refugees in the country.

“I’m lucky to have grown up in Malaysia in a family with a long history of strong progressive values, where political engagement and activism were always encouraged.

So it was probably inevitable that I’d eventually join The Greens once Australia became home,” she said in The Greens website.

Ms Thomas said she is inspired by the activism of young people, the potential for minority government, and the global solidarity among workers and marginalised communities.

She said the resilience of the Palestinian people and First Nations communities in Australia further fuels her optimism for a just future.

Ms Thomas is also the youngest candidate running against the Prime Minister.

“As someone who is currently renting, who wants to buy a first home, considering whether or not to have children, I guess I relate more to young people here,” she said in a recent interview with Australian TV programme The Feed SBS, which was shared on its Facebook page.

This election marks a historic moment where the Greens emerge as a formidable opposition in the Prime Minister’s own seat, striving to deliver a powerful message of change to the Albanese Government.

“For the first time, an Australian Prime Minister’s biggest threat is in his own seat against the Greens.

“It’s an incredible opportunity to send the loudest possible message to the Albanese Government that we deserve better, that we deserve a government that tackles the problems that everyday people face,” she said.

The Australian federal election is scheduled for May 3 to elect members of the 48th Parliament.

Voters will decide all 150 seats in the House of Representatives and 40 out of 76 seats in the Senate.

The Labor government, headed by Mr Albanese, is vying for a second term, facing off against the Liberal/National Coalition led by opposition leader Peter Dutton.

Several minor parties and independents, including the Greens party, are also participating in the election. THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK

Despite this, many East Malaysians do not feel that their position within Malaysia has been beneficial. Due to their natural resource wealth, these states generate a substantial proportion of federal government revenue and yet suffer high rates of poverty and insufficient infrastructure investment.





Furthermore, since their inclusion into Malaysia, the federal government has gradually encroached on the rights and responsibilities initially accorded to the Sarawak and Sabah governments. This was enabled by Barisan Nasional’s commanding majorities in parliament, and strict control over component parties—including those from East Malaysia.





However, in Malaysia’s current political context, East Malaysian parties are now kingmakers, as any national coalition must gain their support to be viable. Sarawak is particularly influential since its ruling coalition, Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS), is virtually invulnerable.





GPS used to be part of BN but left the grouping in 2018 and is now proudly independent. Keenly aware of its influence, GPS supported the two previous national coalitions and steadily increased its share of cabinet positions as well as the status accorded to its leaders.





Anwar Ibrahim’s Madani administration is also dependent on GPS, and negotiations on pending East Malaysian and specifically Sarawakian issues are gathering steam. The state is pushing for greater control over natural resources, autonomy over the provision of public services, and more political representation.





Progress has been made in many areas, with agreements by both governments over natural gas and social services. However, other areas are more complex to handle, with petroleum revenue-sharing and political representation being particularly daunting.





While further progress is likely, the prime minister faces constraints. There are considerable financial implications in yielding too much to Sarawak, and that could embolden state governments on the peninsula, some of whom are already pushing for more resources and autonomy, to seek more autonomy.





This book is on the press and will be available for purchase from 14 May 2025.

The first two of Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM)’s third-gen Electric Train Service (ETS3) trainsets have arrived in Malaysia and have been assembled, the New Straits Times reports, citing Bernama.

The new ETS3 trains will serve the southern sector of the West Coast Line, which is expected to be fully electrified and double-tracked all the way to JB Sentral by year-end.

“If all the tests proceed smoothly, the trains are expected to begin operations by August. Apart from the first two sets, the remaining eight are being assembled in stages at the China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation (CRRC) plant in Batu Gajah.

“All 10 sets are expected to be completed and fully operational by early next year,” transport minister Anthony Loke said, adding that currently, over 85% of CRRC’s Batu Gajah plant workforce are Malaysian.

“This high workforce composition not only contributes to the development of the national rail industry, but also puts Malaysia on a solid track to becoming a regional rail engineering hub in the future,” he said.

ETS currently uses Class 91 (first gen, Hyundai Rotem-Mitsubishi Electric) and Class 93 (second gen, CRRC Zhuzhou) trainsets – according to Railway Gazette International, the third-gen trains will be given the designation Class 94.

A man recently voiced a similar concern, advising tourists to bear in mind that many of the people they encounter while travelling in Malaysia are foreign workers — particularly if they are inclined to form a negative perception of the country.

“90% of the people in the service industry — such as waiters, waitresses, cashiers, cooks — at commercialised restaurants or chains are not Malaysians. The same goes for most of the security guards too.

“So, please don’t be quick to judge or blame them. They might not understand English as well as us Malaysians,” he claimed on Threads.

The man said he shared these sentiments after witnessing a tourist at a shopping mall asking a cleaner a question, alleging that the cleaner did not speak English and had only learned a little Bahasa Melayu.

“He tried to explain (to the tourist) using the little Bahasa he knew, but the tourist thought he was being uncooperative,” he said.

While the man intended to highlight the high number of foreign workers in Malaysia, his post was met with differing opinions, with many users opposing his view.

“This is funny because 90% of my bad experiences in Malaysia are with locals, not foreigners,” one user quipped.

“This is not good advice. There are also Malaysians working in the service industry. As for the non-Malaysian staff, I’ve found them to be some of the nicest people,” another user chimed in.

“Does it matter whether the workers are Malaysian or not? A bad experience is a bad experience, regardless,” remarked another user.

Other commenters, however, understood the man’s point of view — with many agreeing that tourists should learn some basic Bahasa Melayu, as it is the national language.

“Their first language is neither English nor Bahasa Malaysia. There’s a good chance they didn’t receive much education due to poverty. However, the fact that foreign workers speak in Bahasa Melayu is a testament to their effort. Tourists — most of whom only speak one language — need to understand that,” one user observed.

“Everyone was very nice when we visited Kuala Lumpur and Melaka. But it’s true — it helps to speak a bit of Bahasa Melayu mixed with English,” another netizen commented.",1.74578E+12,en,-0.56982547,2025-04-27 03:00:00,"['traveling', 'uncooperative', 'staff', 'found', 'resident', 'high', 'particularly', 'explain', 'bear', 'tried', 'tourist', 'understand', 'either', 'advice', 'judge', 'perception', 'cashier', 'man', 'testament', 'security', 'ive', 'dont', 'asking', 'matter', 'direction', 'chain', 'learned', 'another', 'worker', 'lumpur', 'restaurant', 'shared', 'witnessing', 'opposing', 'difficult', 'alleging', 'question', 'malaysian', 'intended', 'number', 'everyone', 'waitress', 'quick', 'also', 'understood', 'learn', 'netizen', 'good', 'recently', 'thought', 'barrier', 'bahasa', 'experience', 'nonmalaysian', 'agreeing', 'working', 'similar', 'one', 'nice', 'knew', 'english', 'regardless', 'melaka', 'basic', 'form', 'might', 'party', 'remarked', 'shopping', 'view', 'didnt', 'met', 'chance', 'well', 'highlight', 'visited', 'chimed', 'bad', 'however', 'point', 'waiter', 'thread', 'nicest', 'observed', 'quipped', 'foreigner', 'sentiment', 'education', 'effort', 'inclined', 'cook', 'simple', 'mind', 'little', 'poverty', 'service', 'first', 'need', 'there', 'country', 'voiced', 'encounter', 'funny', 'neither', 'people', 'bit', 'mall', 'communicate', 'claimed', 'melayu', 'travelling', 'national', 'negative', 'help', 'fact', 'advising', 'mixed', 'receive', 'please', 'commented', 'concern', 'kuala', 'guard', 'foreign', 'opinion', 'user', 'local', 'much', 'whether', 'language', 'due', 'challenging', 'industry', 'malaysia', 'said', 'many', 'post', 'true', 'blame', 'even', 'differing', 'making', 'using', 'cleaner', 'commercialised', 'commenters', 'speak']",Negative

Hotels in Penang, particularly along the northern coast, which relies on water from the Teluk Bahang dam, were bustling with locals looking to unwind.

Some even introduced “no- water” packages.

Engineer Nur Liyana Mazlan, 37, was seen enjoying pool time with her husband and two daughters at a hotel in Tanjung Bungah.

“We live in Bayan Lepas. Our apartment block has rooftop tanks but we did not want to take any chances.

“We knew Tanjung Bungah is unaffected, so we thought it would make for a great weekend getaway,” she said, adding that they were pleased the hotel offered a no-water package.

Oi Hui Sin, 39, was spotted enjoying the hotel’s buffet breakfast with her extended family of seven, who had taken a family suite.

“We cannot travel far with our eight-month-old son, so a hotel on the island was the best option,” she said yesterday.

Ooi said she lives in Sungai Ara here while her parents’ home is on the mainland.

“It was a last-minute thing. Just before the water cut, we decided on this holiday after seeing the promotional packages,” said the engineer.

Ooi said they would have checked out later yesterday as her son has school today.

“We stored some water at home but didn’t have to worry much because we were away,” she explained.

Ooi said many of her colleagues also chose local hotel stays or travelled out of state for the weekend.

“The roads are quieter as well. This has been a wonderful mini-break close to home,” she added.

Flamingo Hotel by the Beach general manager Ong Hai Leong said he was surprised by the influx of Penangites checking-in over the weekend.

“We had an occupancy rate of more than 90%, which is not common for a typical weekend.

“There were many last-minute bookings,” he said.

Royale Chulan Penang general manager Dennis Lee said the weekend saw a significant rise in bookings, driven by various promotions, with nearly full occupancy.

Travel agent David Chee was overwhelmed with work as the number of trips he organised to Haadyai in Thailand and Genting Highlands surged by more than 300%.

“We’ve had seven vans to Haad­yai, along with two buses and five vans to Genting Highlands every day since last Thursday,” he said.

Chee added that the past two weeks had been hectic, managing customers and handling enqui­ries. This unusual situation unfol­ded as Penang faced a water cut affecting around 1.4 million people.

The scheduled disruption was due to major repairs and upgrades to the state’s water grid, parti­cularly a main pipeline that supplies treated water from Sungai Muda, at the northern border of Seberang Prai, to 80% of the state.

Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow announced that all repairs had been completed as of 1.48pm yesterday.

He said water supply was being restored gradually, although it could take until later today for residents living in the outskirts of the water grid to have running taps.

All new cars are EVs, right? Seems so, feels so, but thankfully no. This is the new MINI Cooper Convertible, and it’s not powered by batteries; instead, there’s a good ol’ 2.0-litre turbo-four under the hood producing 204 hp and 300 Nm in ‘S’ spec, paired to a seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox. This fun little thing does the 0-100 km/h sprint in 6.9 seconds and its top speed is 237 km/h.

If you’re confused, we don’t blame you. MINI is straddling ICE and EV with its latest models, and this latest Convertible, codenamed F67, is a variation of the F66 3 Door and F65 5 Door models. Despite the similar looks, these siblings aren’t related to the all-electric J01 Cooper SE, which is built on a new platform in conjunction with GWM in China. This car rolls out of MINI Plant Oxford.

Like the hatchback, the convertible version of the fourth-generation MINI is cute and dinky (for modern standards, it’s just 3,879 mm long) and wears a more minimal look compared to the previous generation. The 2,495 mm wheelbase is very long for such a small footprint, and that’s because the wheels – 18-inch ‘Night Flash’ spoke two-tone items – sit at the car’s edges in typical MINI fashion.

What’s special is the ability to drive without a barrier between head and sky. The fabric contraption, fully automatic of course, does its thing in 18 seconds, and you can operate it at speeds of up to 30 km/h – no need to pull over. Closing takes 15 seconds.

Standard cabriolet stuff there, but what’s nice is a ‘sunroof’ function where the soft top slides back to reveal an opening of up to 40 cm. This gives you an opening without being fully exposed to traffic and elements, which can be inappropriate and/or uncomfortable sometimes. An ‘Always Open Timer’ in the screen tracks how many minutes you’ve done with the roof down – please make sure the score is high!

An integrated rollover protection system is activated automatically as soon as the central safety electronics detect a risk of rollover. If you need to ask about boot space, perhaps a tiny drop top isn’t for you. Anyway, it’s just 215 litres with the roof in place and just 160 litres with the contraption stored away. Enough for grocery runs and short weekend getaways but not a long balik kampung trip.

Inside, the Convertible also gets the latest generation’s minimalist interior with interesting dash fabrics. The fabric theme is also found on on the newly sports steering’s bottom spoke. They call the round central screen the MINI Interaction Unit, and it’s a super-sharp OLED touchscreen with a 240 mm diameter. No traditional meter panel ahead of the steering, but there’s a head-up display so you can keep your head straight.

South of the dinner plate is a new Toggle Bar that offers direct physical access to often-used functions such as the parking brake, gear selection, start/stop switch, Experience Modes and volume control. Below this cluster is a phone holder that allows your device to sit upright for easy viewing.

Also included in the kit list are MINI Navigation AR, anti-dazzle mirrors, wireless charging, comfort access system, Comfort Package Plus and a 12-speaker, eight-channel Harman Kardon surround sound system. You’ll also get Driving Assistant Plus and Parking Assistant Plus – the former is a comprehensive ADAS pack and the latter includes auto parking (parallel and perpendicular), cameras, drive recorder and anti-theft recorder.

The MINI App gives an owner access to a variety of functions. Remote 3D View – generated via the car’s exterior cameras – takes a snapshot of the surroundings of your parked MINI, while Remote Engine Start allows the driver to start the engine remotely and cool the cabin before the journey. MINI Digital Key Plus is also available, transforming your smartphone into the car key. Browse the MINI Connected Store for apps that suit your fancy.

The new MINI Cooper Convertible is your toy for RM318,888 with the standard two-year, unlimited-mileage warranty. The four-year extended warranty and service package can be added on for RM10,400, which brings the price to RM329,288. Choose from Copper Grey, Sunny Side Yellow and Ocean Wave Green colours. Pics of the latter two shades are below.

We don’t have many roadsters in the market these days; coincidentally, Mazda launched the latest ‘ND3’ MX-5 earlier this month for just below RM300k. Same ballpark price but a very different kettle of small fish – both are 2.0L but the Mazda is NA RWD while the MINI is turbo FWD. Hiroshima’s icon is available with a manual gearbox, while the MINI is faster and more usable. They’re unlikely to be cross shopped, but variety is surely a good thing.

Anyway, if you like the new ICE-powered MINI, why not top up a small amount for a big difference in driving experience?

Two data centres are being developed in Negeri Sembilan, Bernama reported, citing the state’s Chief Minister Aminuddin Harun. One will be a green data centre developed by US investors, while the other is an artificial intelligence data centre by local construction firm Gamuda Bhd, he said on Monday (Apr 28).

The data centres were drawn to the state’s ability to meet their infrastructure requirements and its good highway network, Aminuddin said. Negeri Sembilan is located on Malaysia’s southwest coast, and is about an hour’s drive from Kuala Lumpur.

The data-centre boom is spilling over to Negeri Sembilan, with Malaysia’s southern state of Johor slowing the pace of approvals amid concerns that the facilities were putting a strain on its resources. The spurt helped investments in Johor climb 12 per cent to RM48.5 billion (S$14.6 billion) last year.

Aminuddin said Gamuda will construct and develop a water treatment plant with a capacity of 67 million litres (17.7 million gallons) per day to ensure sufficient supply for areas surrounding the data centres. The state government will carefully assess future data centre proposals given their high water needs, he added.

Subsidies on eggs will be reduced to five sen from 10 sen per unit before being fully scrapped on August 1, 2025, the ministry said in a statement. The decision was made after considering industry commitment to ensure “sufficient and guaranteed” supply as production costs stabilised, it noted.

“The government has also taken into account that prolonged price control and subsidy is unsustainable for the local egg producing industry as well as the country's finances,” MAFS said.

The government has spent close to RM2.5 billion between February 2022 and December 2024 for subsidies on eggs to help producers cope with rising costs of soybean and corn following the Covid-19 pandemic and Ukraine-Russia conflict.

The removal of egg subsidies is the latest step in the government’s ongoing fiscal consolidation efforts.

To minimise the impact on cost of living, MAFS said it will, together with the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Cost of Living, take intervention measures including introducing a new grade of eggs at “reasonable” price and stepping up enforcement to curb profiteering and price manipulation.",1.74602E+12,en,-0.126750112,2025-04-30 01:59:07,"['per', 'following', 'removal', 'supply', 'cope', 'stabilised', 'including', 'conflict', 'prolonged', 'security', 'trade', 'step', 'producing', 'mafs', 'agriculture', 'decision', 'guaranteed', 'fiscal', 'sufficient', 'covid', 'considering', 'lumpur', 'domestic', 'food', 'fully', 'taken', 'manipulation', 'introducing', 'may', 'together', 'egg', 'living', 'also', 'consolidation', 'production', 'reasonable', 'profiteering', 'wednesday', 'end', 'corn', 'retargeting', 'ministry', 'latest', 'rising', 'commitment', 'enforcement', 'control', 'impact', 'curb', 'account', 'well', 'grade', 'december', 'reduced', 'august', 'statement', 'unit', 'effective', 'noted', 'stepping', 'effort', 'cost', 'measure', 'price', 'close', 'country', 'soybean', 'unsustainable', 'phased', 'sen', 'spent', 'ensure', 'made', 'five', 'help', 'finance', 'kuala', 'part', 'government', 'february', 'ukrainerussia', 'ongoing', 'minimise', 'take', 'local', 'subsidy', 'intervention', 'april', 'industry', 'malaysia', 'producer', 'said', 'billion', 'pandemic', 'new', 'scrapped']",Neutral

export,What next for Southeast Asia’s China-backed solar boom?,1.74594E+12,Dialogue Earth,dialogue.earth,https://news.google.com/read/CBMikAFBVV95cUxOZ20xbm9zdjVQME5xWlNReWJkWEljUjM4Qm1NQ3dCa1RTZkdEeTliQW9UUG94cXNaRHZSbF9UeDVTTUVUYlQ0LXFGYVBiNzdYaUJKRUJCLWVRSHJMVXJiaEpMU0lldEUyMXdwMXhjd0pMRDRmUTlIU0QwSmc1V2VtVVNva3ZMZHNhSzFEeHhQY3U?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://dialogue.earth/en/energy/what-next-for-southeast-asias-china-backed-solar-boom/,"In little over a decade, Southeast Asia has become one of the world’s top exporters of solar power equipment – a success driven significantly by the relocation of Chinese manufacturers to the region. But now, the sector faces considerable challenges as US tariffs cut off their main export market, intensifying pressure on a previously booming trade.

Ever since finding themselves in the crosshairs of US import tariffs in 2012, Chinese solar manufacturers began shifting their production to Southeast Asia to circumvent trade barriers. More recently, overcapacity and brutal price wars in China’s domestic market have accelerated these international relocations.

The arrival of factories backed by Chinese solar heavyweights such as Trina, Longi, JA Solar and Jinko Solar, among nearly 20 other competitors, has transformed Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia into world-leading production and export hubs for a range of solar components. Together, these countries account for over 40% of global manufacturing capacity of solar modules outside China, and around 20% of worldwide exports.

Southeast Asia’s solar exports have primarily targeted the US, with more than 80% of the equipment it imported in the first half of 2024 sourced from Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia, according to BloombergNEF.

But this successful run is now under threat. In June 2024, then-US president Joe Biden ended a two-year relief on import tariffs for solar panels from the region’s four leading producers, targeting China-linked manufacturers over alleged unfair business practices. Additional levies announced in November prompted several Chinese manufacturers to suspend or scale-back production or shift operations to Indonesia and Laos, which were exempted.

This uncertainty has now been exacerbated by President Donald Trump’s 21 April announcement of hefty tariffs on Southeast Asian solar manufacturers, reaching unprecedented heights of up to 3,521% for some exporters, though varying by country and company. Trina Solar, for example, has been hit with tariffs totalling 375% on its production in Thailand, while Jinko Solar will face rates of 120% on its exports from Vietnam, but lower levies of 40.3% from Malaysia.

Prior to this latest round of tariffs, Dialogue Earth spoke with experts and analysts to hear more about Chinese solar manufacturers’ presence in Southeast Asia, the reception they have received, and what may lie ahead for an industry feeling the heat of global trade tensions.

A triangular trade

The solar sector is just one aspect of a broader trend of Chinese manufacturing investments reshaping Southeast Asia. Investments in the 10 countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) reached USD 17.6 billion in 2023, according to a recent report by the Asia Society, a US-based think-tank. Besides solar, other key sectors include electric vehicles, batteries and steel.

According to the Asia Society, this investment surge has been driven by Chinese companies’ aiming to avoid trade barriers in advanced economies, to seek lower production costs, and to capitalise on Asean’s strategic position as a global gateway.

Notable Chinese solar investments include Trina Solar’s two factories in Vietnam, producing silicon wafers and solar cells, with a third, USD 454 million, 25-hectare facility announced. Longi has spent more than USD 1.1 billion on multiple facilities in Malaysia, employing over 8,000 people as of 2023, although some operations have reportedly halted in response to tariffs.

Yang Muyi, senior energy analyst at global energy think-tank Ember, said that Chinese technological expertise had helped to accelerate Southeast Asia’s own solar industry.

“China’s success in solar manufacturing did not happen overnight; it was the result of decades of sustained policy support, including long-term investment, research and development funding, and the development of integrated industrial clusters,” Yang told Dialogue Earth. “Even with these strong domestic policies, it still took years for Chinese companies to become global leaders.”

China-backed projects in Southeast Asia have attracted capital, created jobs and supported the upgrading of local industries, he added.

Such industrial development is among the reasons that Southeast Asian governments “have been nearly uniformly welcoming of and seeking out” increased Chinese foreign direct investment, the Asia Society report’s authors wrote. The economic benefits have been substantial, with US solar imports from Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia reaching USD 12 billion in 2023 alone. However, the Asia Society report warned of risks from over-dependence on Chinese industrial inputs and investments amid growing global trade tensions – underscored by the Biden-era tariffs, which caused US solar imports from the region to plummet in the second half of 2024.

Not all Chinese investments have been welcomed locally. Putra Adhiguna, managing director of the Energy Shift Institute, an Asia-focused energy finance think-tank, highlighted controversies surrounding Chinese company Xinyi’s solar manufacturing project on Rempang Island, Indonesia. The solar facility, part of designs for a new “eco city”, sparked protests in 2023 from local communities over plans to evict thousands of residents. Construction has since remained stalled as the government continues to negotiate relocations, reportedly now pursuing a “softer approach”. In March, Indonesia’s transmigration minister issued an official apology to residents who had previously been forcibly evicted.

Responding to tariffs

Even before the Biden administration’s 2024 tariff increases, Chinese solar companies in Southeast Asia had already begun pre-emptively shifting their strategies to avoid trade barriers. Data from the Rhodium Group, a China-focused research provider, shows a significant pivot in Chinese solar investments in 2022 and 2023 towards Laos and, in particular, Indonesia. Previously receiving little attention, these two nations saw billion-dollar commitments, accounting for almost half of the region’s total solar investments over this period.

Other Chinese-linked projects in Indonesia include Trina’s Mas Agra solar cell and module factory, which began operations in October 2024, and Thornova’s new solar module facility launched in November with plans previously announced to export to the US by mid-2025.

However, such ambitions now face major hurdles following the Trump administration’s slew of tariffs. These include not only those targeting solar manufacturers, but also its so-called “reciprocal” tariffs on around 90 nations, launched earlier in April, though later paused until July.

Speaking to Malaysian publication The Edge, Davis Chong, president of the Malaysia Photovoltaic Industry Association, described Chinese-owned firms in the country as having already been almost “killed off” by previous US tariffs. Though the most recent solar tariffs will require final confirmation by the US International Trade Commission in June before coming into effect, Chong said the association expected more Chinese manufacturers to leave the market. Earlier in the month, Bloomberg analysts had similarly suggested US tariffs “might induce producers to leave Southeast Asia altogether” in favour of regions such as the Middle East.

As the US becomes an increasingly inaccessible export market, the possibility of the region looking to alternative markets has been raised. “It’s not so much about Southeast Asian nations reducing their dependency on China as it is about reducing their dependency on the US as a market,” Grant Hauber, strategic energy finance advisor for Asia at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, told Dialogue Earth.

However, the short-term outlook for diversifying export markets seems mixed. The European Union, for example, sources 97% of its solar equipment directly from China, which it has not subjected to tariffs, leaving little room for Southeast Asian producers to quickly offset their losses from the previously dominant US market. Though the bloc’s 2024 European Solar Charter encouraged diversification of supply chains, highlighting risks in the reliance on China, its focus was largely on supporting European manufacturers that have struggled to compete with the low prices driven by Chinese production – prices with which Southeast Asian solar exporters will also be competing in the EU market.

Can local markets plug the gap?

Amidst ongoing trade uncertainties between the US and China, Southeast Asia’s domestic markets could offer a valuable hedge against external uncertainties, according to Yang.

He said accelerating domestic transitions towards clean electricity could generate substantial local demand for solar equipment and infrastructure. But, he cautioned, “there is little time to wait as other regions move quickly to scale up their clean energy industries”.

Despite significant manufacturing capacity growth, local solar installations across Southeast Asia have been inconsistent. “The results for domestic solar installations have been mixed, with growth varying, and driven more by country-level policies,” said Adhiguna.



Vietnam stands out with 18.4GW of installed capacity as of 2023, driven by a robust feed-in tariff scheme for solar and wind, “which saw Vietnam go from nowhere on the renewables map to one of the top markets in the world in just two years,” explained Hauber.

We have a fossil fuel hangover in the region… leaving them behind is hard Grant Hauber, strategic energy finance advisor for Asia, Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis

However, experts pointed to barriers that prevent the region absorbing its surplus export capacity domestically. High among these may be the dominance of fossil fuel interests regionally.

Chalie Charoenlarpnopparut, an associate professor at Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology in Bangkok, described policymakers in Thailand as being “scared” of solar development due to competition with established natural gas interests. Regulatory hurdles are slowing approvals for solar projects – large and small: “Even for households or a small business, if they want to install solar rooftop, they still have some difficulties,” he said.

In Indonesia, meanwhile, coal interests are proving hard to overcome, despite pledges to phase-out fuel by 2040. “We have a fossil fuel hangover in the region – Indonesia’s state-owned enterprises and key individuals built their wealth and power from those sources, and leaving them behind is hard,” said Hauber.

Further barriers identified by Hauber include grid connectivity issues, logistical and labour costs, as well as the limited production range of solar components within individual countries. “Governments think if they sign a deal with a solar panel manufacturer, they’ll have solar power made in their country. No, it’s not: it’s one small component. It’s shiny, high-tech and sexy, but it doesn’t get you electricity to the grid.”

Adhiguna echoed Hauber’s view on the need for a broad diversification of Southeast Asia’s solar markets – within and beyond the region, or focusing on domestic demand. He recommended deepening involvement across the solar value chain, despite acknowledging the significant challenges involved. “It’s not easy, as production in early products such as polysilicon is capital-intensive, amid fierce market competition. Deepening the value chain will, nevertheless, likely bring mutual benefits for both the Chinese companies and Southeast Asian countries’ long-term outlook.”

Adhiguna remained optimistic about Southeast Asia’s solar potential, but stressed the importance of improving the sector’s offering amid intensifying competition from places such as India, which are increasingly localising solar manufacturing. “Investors would like to see a clear project pipeline that they can deliver in the short-to-medium term, not too far in the horizon,” he added.

export,"Taiwan’s economy grows most in a year on front-loading, AI",1.74601E+12,The Edge Malaysia,theedgemalaysia.com,https://news.google.com/read/CBMiUEFVX3lxTFBzMkZodlVONkhpNWl4cmhaWm5iRTRZaElDTk85MFFOSmpEMU9TMm9CU28tZjR3bXItSWM2LUtGblpuQzhkMzZ1bWRrZlN3aVYw?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/753581,"(April 30): Taiwan’s economy grew at the fastest pace in a year, fuelled by a surge in exports as companies rushed shipments to avoid US tariffs and rising demand for artifial intelligence-related (AI) hardware.

Gross domestic product expanded 5.4% from a year earlier in the first quarter (1Q), according to a statement by the statistics bureau in Taipei on Wednesday. That was significantly higher than the 3.6% growth estimated by economists surveyed by Bloomberg.

While growth will likely slow as levies bite, the bureau upgraded its forecast to 3.6% expansion this year, from a previous estimate of 3.1%. The projection, however, doesn’t factor in tariffs announced since US President Donald Trump returned to the White House.

“Robust global tech demand is behind the acceleration, masking underlying risks. The reality is — Taiwan’s trade-driven economy could face significant headwinds if Trump proceeds with his tariff agenda,” says Hyosung Kwon, economist at Bloomberg Economics.

Taiwan’s export-oriented economy has benefitted from a surge in global demand for its high-tech products underpinning AI development in recent years. Exports from the island in 1Q rose to a record US$129.6 billion (RM560.7 billion), with shipments to the US and Asean countries seeing new highs in March.

Exports of goods and services jumped 20.1% year over year, according to the advance estimates, while imports rose 23.7%.

Front-loading in response to US tariff hikes and the gradual elimination of supply chain bottlenecks for high-end information technology products contributed to the economy’s growth, according to the bureau’s statement.

On April 2, Trump announced sweeping “reciprocal tariffs” on almost all economies. Taiwan was slapped with a 32% levy, although the higher duty was later postponed for 90 days.

The tariff threat has prompted economists and analysts to lower their estimates for Taiwan’s economic growth this year, with Morgan Stanley cutting its forecast to 2.2% from 3.4%. The Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research, a semi-official think tank based in Taipei, even projected that growth could drop to 0.16% in the worst-case scenario.

With uncertainty looming, Morgan Stanley analysts expect Taiwan’s central bank to begin its rate-cutting cycle as early as September.

Taipei has pledged to reduce non-tariff trade barriers and said it would increase purchases of American energy, agricultural products and military goods. The island’s Premier Cho Jung-tai has said that trade talks are expected to take place in May.

Earlier in April, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, Taiwan’s biggest company and the go-to supplier of the most advanced chips for Nvidia Corp and Apple Inc, reported better-than-expected results for 1Q.

This amount is the highest in the last 20 years, with the export value reaching US$10 million. ""This export is a strategic step to strengthen our position in the global market,"" said President Director of PT AM/NS Indonesia, Murali Krishna Chunduru, at the export release event at Tanjung Priok Port on Wednesday, April 30, 2025.

Murali explained that the U.S. and Canada are currently the company's main markets. He targets exports to the U.S. to reach 5,000 to 6,000 tons per month, while to Canada, about 3,000 to 4,000 tons per quarter, depending on market dynamics.

In addition to strengthening existing markets, the company targets new markets such as Europe, Malaysia, and Australia. According to Murali, this expansion opportunity arises in line with the trade protection policies implemented by several countries.

Despite the continued growth in export performance, Murali highlighted the challenges faced by the national steel industry, especially regarding regulations. ""We need protection from the entry of non-standard steel that has not been maximally regulated,"" he said.

Regarding the entry tariffs to the U.S., Murali mentioned that Indonesian steel products are subject to a flat tariff of 25 percent based on the Section 232 policy implemented since President Donald Trump took office. However, He believes this policy will create opportunities for his company. ""Despite being affected by Trump's tariffs, we can still compete. Other countries such as China, Vietnam, and India are subject to much higher anti-dumping tariffs,"" he explained.

With advantages in quality and price, PT AM/NS Indonesia is optimistic about remaining competitive in the global market. ""We excel in quality and price. This is what makes us remain competitive in the American market,"" said Murali.

Furthermore, he conveyed that PT AM/NS Indonesia has been a lightweight steel supplier to the U.S. since 2004. The main products exported include galvanized steel and cold-rolled coil. This year, the company targets total sales of 300,000 tons, growing by around 8 to 9 percent compared to the previous year. ""We continue to maintain world-class manufacturing standards and innovate to meet domestic and international market demands,"" he concluded.

These results come from the Economic Census 2023, which examined businesses fully or partially owned by women.

The census, which followed national and international classification standards, showed a significant increase in women’s involvement in the country’s business landscape. The previous census, conducted in 2016, was based on data from 2015.

The census found that there were 219,015 women-owned businesses in 2022, with 185,582 classified as SMEs, making up 17% of all SMEs in Malaysia.

A majority of these businesses (93.6%) were concentrated in the services sector, followed by manufacturing (3.9%) and construction (1.8%).

The wholesale and retail trade (45%), and food and beverage (31.1%) sub-sectors dominated, collectively accounting for over 76% of women-owned businesses.

The wholesale and retail trade sector particularly benefited from the rise of e-commerce, fast-moving consumer goods, technology and fashion industries, driven by increased internet usage and growing demand for electronics, automobiles and apparel.

The information and communication sub-sector showed the highest growth, with an average annual increase of 31.8%, followed by accommodation (21.8%), and professional, scientific, and technical services (7.2%).

Women-owned businesses generated a gross output of RM136.9 billion, with the services sector contributing RM83.0 billion. This output grew by 7% annually from 2015 to 2022, driven by growth in manufacturing (13.8%), agriculture (6%) and services (5.7%).

SMEs alone accounted for RM89.3 billion in output and RM44.3 billion in value added, reflecting a steady annual growth rate of 3.7% and 4.1%, respectively.

Selangor led the country with the highest number of women-owned businesses, totalling 34,720 establishments, or 15.9% of the total. It was followed by Sabah (22,740 businesses), Kelantan (21,079 businesses), Kuala Lumpur (20,237 businesses), and Johor (19,495 businesses).

Together, these five states accounted for over half of all women-owned businesses in Malaysia.

Selangor also experienced the highest growth in women-owned businesses, with an average annual increase of 3.5% from 2015 to 2022. Johor followed with a growth rate of 2.8%.

However, Putrajaya experienced a decline of 0.8%, with only 335 businesses in 2022, down from 355 in 2015. This drop is attributed to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, which severely affected small businesses, leading to fewer customers, increased operational costs, and supply chain disruptions.

Women-owned businesses employed 979,812 people in 2022, with the majority (80.5%) working in the services sector. The total wages paid by these businesses amounted to RM20.5 billion, with the mining sector offering the highest average monthly salary at RM2,675.",1.74611E+12,en,0.552402616,2025-04-30 08:10:58,"['average', 'sector', 'involvement', 'annually', 'supply', 'found', 'amounted', 'usage', 'particularly', 'employed', 'electronics', 'retail', 'respectively', 'trade', 'finding', 'fewer', 'monthly', 'classified', 'agriculture', 'chain', 'putrajaya', 'salary', 'covid', 'lumpur', 'food', 'totalling', 'fully', 'automobile', 'highest', 'woman', 'accommodation', 'annual', 'driven', 'value', 'classification', 'added', 'drop', 'construction', 'number', 'together', 'severely', 'come', 'enterprise', 'international', 'womenowned', 'increase', 'majority', 'economic', 'also', 'based', 'good', 'generated', 'census', 'grew', 'working', 'business', 'examined', 'alone', 'medium', 'state', 'latest', 'rise', 'significant', 'scientific', 'impact', 'mining', 'output', 'wage', 'wholesale', 'increased', 'customer', 'technology', 'selangor', 'led', 'attributed', 'subsectors', 'beverage', 'previous', 'internet', 'standard', 'however', 'womens', 'gross', 'landscape', 'kelantan', 'decline', 'accounted', 'disruption', 'demand', 'cost', 'partially', 'result', 'leading', 'information', 'service', 'manufacturing', 'operational', 'professional', 'country', 'fastmoving', 'technical', 'people', 'subsector', 'dominated', 'concentrated', 'national', 'five', 'growth', 'fashion', 'total', 'conducted', 'according', 'contributing', 'kuala', 'experienced', 'half', 'benefited', 'collectively', 'communication', 'ecommerce', 'growing', 'rate', 'offering', 'followed', 'showed', 'smes', 'sabah', 'affected', 'data', 'establishment', 'april', 'accounting', 'industry', 'department', 'malaysia', 'paid', 'owned', 'apparel', 'billion', 'pandemic', 'making', 'johor', 'statistic', 'small', 'consumer', 'reflecting', 'dosm', 'steady']",Positive

Speaking at his weekly post-Cabinet media briefing, Fahmi said the proposed revisions form part of a broader policy decision led by the Ministry of Home Affairs, following a commitment made by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim in Parliament on February 13.

“The Minister of Home Affairs Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail informed the Cabinet that from 2022 to 2024, 99 per cent of all peaceful assembly applications in Malaysia were approved,” said Fahmi. “This is a very encouraging figure when we look at the statistics, but we believe the amendments to be tabled will further strengthen the public’s right to peaceful assembly.”

The Prime Minister had previously announced that the government had agreed to amend Act 736 to streamline and support the implementation of peaceful gatherings across the country. Among the expected changes is the removal of Section 11 of the Act, which currently requires organisers to obtain consent from the owner or occupier of the location where a gathering is to be held.

However, organisers would still be required to notify the Police at least five days before the event to allow for adequate safety, control, and traffic arrangements.

Subsidy Reform for Eggs Begins in May as Government Ensures Supply Stability

In a separate announcement, Fahmi said the government would begin phasing out egg subsidies starting May 1, while ensuring close monitoring to prevent any disruption in supply or price spikes that could affect consumers.

The withdrawal process will be overseen by the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Cost of Living (KPDN) alongside the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (KPKM). The subsidy, which currently stands at RM0.10 per egg, will be reduced to RM0.05 on May 1 and eliminated entirely by August 1, 2025. Price controls will also be lifted in stages.

“Egg subsidies were introduced at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the supply chain was disrupted. But today, with stabilised production and improved stock levels, the Cabinet views KPKM’s proposal to remove subsidies as appropriate,” Fahmi explained.

He added, “The proposed decision by KPKM is justified not only for subsidy savings but also because current egg supply exceeds demand.”

KPKM has assured that production levels remain strong and sustainable, and pledged to implement intervention measures if cost-of-living pressures arise.

RM13 Million Boost for Malaysia’s Creative Sector Through New Funding Schemes

Furthering its commitment to cultural development, the government has allocated RM13 million this year to enhance the nation’s creative arts landscape. The funding will be distributed via two schemes administered by MyCreative Ventures: the Music Industry Creative Content Fund (Dana Kandungan Kreatif or DKK) and the 2025 Matching Grant Scheme (Skim Dana Padanan or SDP).

Applications for the DKK Music Industry Fund open immediately, with categories covering Music Performance Grants (open until 11 June), International Marketing and Promotion, and Domestic Marketing and Promotion (available year-round).

“To date, the DKK Music Industry Fund has disbursed RM23 million to 223 recipients, based on merit, feasibility, and market potential – strengthening the national music ecosystem,” Fahmi noted.

The SDP 2025 scheme offers 1-to-1 matching grants of up to RM250,000 per successful project. Eligible projects must be led by registered Malaysian entities and can include performing arts, visual arts, crafts, music, digital content, or interdisciplinary creative fields.

“Applications from creative sectors beyond MyCreative’s core portfolio will also be considered, provided they meet the programme’s criteria and objectives,” Fahmi added. - April 30, 2025",1.74611E+12,en,0.410205126,2025-04-30 10:29:00,"['beyond', 'per', 'stage', 'minister', 'later', 'following', 'stability', 'removal', 'supply', 'sector', 'across', 'occupier', 'spokesperson', 'stabilised', 'assembly', 'policy', 'upcoming', 'ibrahim', 'amendment', 'criterion', 'provided', 'justified', 'approved', 'ensuring', 'stand', 'appropriate', 'costofliving', 'organiser', 'trade', 'security', 'seri', 'market', 'include', 'cent', 'strong', 'agriculture', 'separate', 'entirely', 'expected', 'decision', 'announcement', 'pressure', 'chain', 'music', 'enhance', 'act', 'covid', 'june', 'owner', 'offer', 'notify', 'look', 'postcabinet', 'proposed', 'domestic', 'food', 'kpkms', 'furthering', 'feasibility', 'performing', 'year', 'change', 'required', 'boost', 'kreatif', 'spike', 'consent', 'performance', 'promotion', 'must', 'requires', 'programme', 'objective', 'visual', 'may', 'nasution', 'height', 'added', 'held', 'current', 'strengthening', 'malaysian', 'proposal', 'fahmi', 'informed', 'event', 'could', 'tabled', 'matching', 'egg', 'exceeds', 'international', 'monitoring', 'living', 'yearround', 'amend', 'introduced', 'cultural', 'also', 'venture', 'weekly', 'recipient', 'adequate', 'based', 'kpkm', 'dkk', 'considered', 'production', 'application', 'affect', 'location', 'creative', 'starting', 'encouraging', 'covering', 'marketing', 'potential', 'today', 'medium', 'ministry', 'prevent', 'explained', 'mycreative', 'form', 'commitment', 'control', 'datuk', 'assured', 'entity', 'previously', 'kandungan', 'believe', 'announced', 'view', 'pledged', 'category', 'fadzi', 'two', 'led', 'parliament', 'open', 'safety', 'stock', 'date', 'peaceful', 'reform', 'reduced', 'august', 'withdrawal', 'however', 'least', 'distributed', 'fund', 'padanan', 'agreed', 'improved', 'eligible', 'core', 'among', 'landscape', 'begin', 'support', 'saving', 'development', 'noted', 'nation', 'disruption', 'craft', 'interdisciplinary', 'figure', 'demand', 'cost', 'briefing', 'eliminated', 'allocated', 'million', 'saifuddin', 'measure', 'price', 'close', 'cabinet', 'alongside', 'country', 'successful', 'revision', 'sdp', 'strengthen', 'merit', 'confirmed', 'obtain', 'traffic', 'scheme', 'art', 'digital', 'affair', 'remove', 'ecosystem', 'gathering', 'implementation', 'arise', 'via', 'made', 'section', 'five', 'disbursed', 'funding', 'national', 'field', 'would', 'remain', 'portfolio', 'right', 'meet', 'allow', 'speaking', 'public', 'october', 'part', 'mycreatives', 'government', 'february', 'broader', 'lifted', 'communication', 'content', 'day', 'anwar', 'streamline', 'overseen', 'kpdn', 'immediately', 'home', 'grant', 'subsidy', 'disrupted', 'intervention', 'sitting', 'available', 'phasing', 'still', 'skim', 'april', 'industry', 'malaysia', 'arrangement', 'said', 'police', 'project', 'level', 'currently', 'prime', 'administered', 'pandemic', 'registered', 'sustainable', 'new', 'process', 'ismail', 'statistic', 'dana', 'consumer', 'implement', 'ensures']",Neutral

KUALA LUMPUR, April 30 (Bernama) -- The Malaysian High Commission in Namibia, in collaboration with Limkokwing University of Creative Technology (LUCT), co-hosted the 2025 Malaysian Education Fair in Windhoek on Tuesday, promoting Malaysia’s tertiary education and strengthening educational ties with Namibia. The education fair, held at the Malaysian Chancery in Windhoek, drew more than 200 Namibian students and guests to explore Malaysia’s globally recognised higher education opportunities. Chargé d’Affaires of Malaysia to Namibia, Datuk Dr Mohamad Rameez Yahaya, said the collaboration with LUCT is a testament to the Malaysian Government’s continued support for its universities in expanding their horizons and attracting more international students to study in Malaysia.

LUCT, founded by the late Tan Sri Lim Kok Wing in Cyberjaya, Malaysia, in 1991, places a special emphasis on creativity and innovation.

Mohamad Rameez said the event demonstrated strong collaboration between the government and private institutions in enhancing educational cooperation between Malaysia and Namibia. He also shared that Malaysia currently hosts 20 public universities, 54 private universities, 39 private university colleges, 10 foreign university branch campuses, 331 private colleges, 36 polytechnics, and 105 community colleges — all contributing to a robust and accessible higher education landscape.

KUALA LUMPUR, April 29 (Bernama) -- The Global South must forge a new path and take the lead to reshape international cooperation, as the stability and security of the world economy are now actively undermined by the current international system, said Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan. Speaking at the BRICS Partners Foreign Ministers Meeting 2025 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Tuesday, he said the flurry of tariffs which have sent shockwaves through the global community are not a threat, but both a revelation and an opportunity. He said the Global South, as a collective, is becoming a key actor in global realignment, and it must not be content with a passive role in global decision-making.

“This is an opportunity, to reshape international cooperation in ways that reflect our strengths, and better serve our needs. “We must be proactive, forward-looking, and united in shaping a cooperative, just world order. Malaysia stands ready to work with BRICS and all partners who share this vision,"" he said when delivering the country’s intervention at a dedicated session themed “The Role of the Global South in Reinforcing Multilateralism” during the meeting. Citing ASEAN as the world’s fifth-largest economy, with a combined GDP of US$3.8 trillion, he said the region offers significant purchasing power, strong export performance and open-minded diplomacy.

Mohamad said that with this emerging role in mind, Malaysia, as the Chair of ASEAN this year, is guiding the region towards unity, economic cohesion, and strategic diversification. “Through our commitment to an open, rules-based, and inclusive regional architecture, ASEAN is focused on strengthening intra-regional trade, developing resilient supply chains, and embracing emerging industries that place sustainability and innovation at their core,” he said. He noted that BRICS, too, is a force for economic resilience, political balance, and social advancement.",1.74613E+12,en,0.35923183,2025-04-30 22:15:03,"['lead', 'minister', 'stability', 'meeting', 'asean', 'forwardlooking', 'supply', 'forge', 'work', 'sustainability', 'vieira', 'embracing', 'cooperation', 'way', 'inclusive', 'export', 'passive', 'stand', 'collective', 'security', 'seri', 'trade', 'unity', 'fifthlargest', 'strong', 'social', 'credit', 'emerging', 'chain', 'cooperative', 'ready', 'dedicated', 'intraregional', 'mohamad', 'lumpur', 'offer', 'chair', 'openminded', 'political', 'world', 'year', 'performance', 'vision', 'must', 'janeiro', 'current', 'trillion', 'strengthening', 'session', 'serve', 'cohesion', 'international', 'delivering', 'power', 'opportunity', 'revelation', 'economic', 'key', 'regional', 'path', 'united', 'ministry', 'diplomacy', 'realignment', 'place', 'commitment', 'combined', 'datuk', 'significant', 'architecture', 'threat', 'strength', 'focused', 'brics', 'diversification', 'undermined', 'open', 'brazilian', 'force', 'role', 'rulesbased', 'reshape', 'citing', 'core', 'resilient', 'tariff', 'gdp', 'tuesday', 'noted', 'region', 'actively', 'sent', 'mind', 'resilience', 'global', 'bernama', 'first', 'need', 'guiding', 'decisionmaking', 'country', 'becoming', 'brazil', 'shaping', 'multilateralism', 'shockwaves', 'innovation', 'order', 'south', 'community', 'share', 'partner', 'proactive', 'speaking', 'towards', 'system', 'kuala', 'rio', 'reflect', 'balance', 'economy', 'content', 'hasan', 'take', 'foreign', 'strategic', 'flurry', 'intervention', 'reinforcing', 'advancement', 'april', 'industry', 'malaysia', 'said', 'purchasing', 'mauro', 'photo', 'actor', 'developing', 'new', 'themed', 'better']",Neutral

He noted that Malaysia has maintained its top position in the Global Islamic Economy Indicator rankings for 10 consecutive years, ahead of Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, and the United Arab Emirates.

""Malaysia's strength lies in Islamic finance, halal food, as well as media and recreation.

""The halal industry constitutes a significant portion of Malaysia's gross domestic product (GDP), with projections estimating a 10.8 per cent contribution or RM231 billion by 2030. This growth is primarily driven by a robust halal ecosystem across sectors such as food, finance, and travel,” he said.

He made these remarks in his officiating speech at the soft launch of the 21st Malaysia International Halal Showcase (MIHAS) 2025, here today. The speech was delivered by deputy secretary-general (Industry) Datuk Hanafi Sakri.

Tengku Zafrul said the global demand for halal products is currently valued at over US$3 trillion and is expected to grow to US$5 trillion by 2030, underscoring the global appeal of halal’s ethical and sustainable attributes.

""Malaysia’s leadership in this sector is a testament to our continued innovation and dedication.

""Among the major international halal market players are Nestlé, Allana Group, Cargill Incorporated and Fraser & Neave. I am proud to note that several Malaysian companies such as DagangHalal Group, Prima Quality Food Industries, Kawan Food Bhd , Crescent Foods, QL Foods Sdn Bhd, and Ayamas Food Corporation, are also recognised among the top players globally,” he said.

He highlighted that this year's MIHAS theme, ""Pinnacle of Halal Excellence”, reflects its standing as the world's leading and most prestigious halal showcase.

""With greater international participation anticipated, MIHAS 2025 is set to be larger and more dynamic than previous editions. It will showcase the latest halal products, services, and technologies, highlighting the industry’s latest advancements,” he said.

MIHAS 2025 is scheduled to take place on Sept 17-20, 2025, at the Malaysia International Trade and Exhibition Centre (MITEC).

Tengku Zafrul also stated that halal-related initiatives are part of the Priority Economic Deliverables for 2025 (PEDs), particularly in the context of Malaysia’s ASEAN chairmanship.

""Malaysia is actively promoting the halal industry as a key driver of economic growth and regional cooperation.

""There will be a dedicated pavilion representing ASEAN’s halal industry, as well as a special pavilion for companies from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which is a strategic partner of ASEAN, featured at MIHAS this year,” he shared.

He also noted that MIHAS’s internationalisation effort debuted in Dubai last year and will continue with an edition in Shanghai this November.

Since its inception in 2004, MIHAS has expanded from 500 booths to 2,100 booths in its most recent edition.

The bank said the transaction was completed based on the net tangible assets (NTA) of EXIM Bank and SME Bank as of 31

December 2023. BPMB Group will now have EXIM Bank and SME Bank as its subsidiaries.

In a statement released today, following the completion of the acquisition, BPMB said the three banks are better positioned to

expand and strengthen their existing mandates to bridge the country’s developmental funding gap. Key pillars in addressing this gap include, among others, support for Bumiputera entrepreneurs, financing for SMEs, fostering inbound and outbound

transactions, and advocating sustainability for growth. Collectively, for 2025, BPMB Group has an allocation of RM8.3 billion to be deployed for national development through its combined strategic programmes.

The bank also added that the acquisition is expected to generate revenue and cost synergies over time as the three

institutions increasingly integrate their resources and expertise to support the growth of Malaysian businesses, both large and small.

Moving forward, BPMB Group said it will implement a holistic integration plan that leverages the strengths and resources of each entity to effectively support the three distinct market segments.

outbreak,Chamber of commerce indicates sustained interest from US investors in Malaysia amid trade tensions,1.74607E+12,The Edge Malaysia,theedgemalaysia.com,https://news.google.com/read/CBMiUEFVX3lxTE5WNjhJd3VpNExZWkF0SWtyWjhtazZnWFhBLW4xQUk4MHB5MmFrdnJrQXN1czctSUZTTFlYdUJEX0d0SHA0Q0pLSFBnd0NiVURv?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/753660,"KUALA LUMPUR (May 1): There is sustained interest coming from US companies looking to invest in Malaysia amid US-China trade tensions.

American Malaysian Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) chief executive officer Datuk Siobhan M Das said the chamber sees interests coming from sectors where traditional investments were attracting.

“I think the attractiveness over the last five years which we have seen grow exponentially is still going to continue. It is a question of what will land in Malaysia. So I think the US-China tensions again go back to providing opportunities.

""The amount of investments that have landed in Malaysia is significant. The US is probably the largest investor [in Malaysia] right now,"" she told Bernama in an interview.

Siobhan was a guest on Bernama TV’s The Nation programme entitled ""In Focus: Malaysia-US Trade Relations"" hosted by Jessy Chahal on Wednesday.

Currently, more than 600 American companies have a presence in Malaysia.

Siobhan said that over the last five years, the sectors that had consistently attracted American investments were the ones of high value, high technology and sectors that required specialty and quality to come out of their investments, which Malaysia is perfectly placed to do.

""Malaysia is perfectly equipped to be able to deliver in that space. The sectors, including E&E (electrical and electronics) of which semiconductors is a part of, remain paramount. Building on that medical technology, you have seen a massive influx of medical technology companies that are here, aerospace, chemicals, and of course, ICT (information and communications technology), are growing as well,"" she added.

Beyond that, Malaysia has a lot of opportunities for new industries such as critical minerals.

According to Malaysia's trade performance report, trade with the US rose by 29.9% in 2024 to RM324.91 billion compared to 2023.

Trade with the US accounted for 11.3% of Malaysia's total trade, with exports to the US in 2024 reaching a new record high, surging 23.2% to RM198.65 billion.

Siobhan said AmCham's strength came from its ability to gather the information from its members and be able to convey them to the government while also working in collaboration with the government.

Asked whether AmCham foresee any rollback or continuation of tariffs under future US administrations, she said that with negotiations and with the understanding that Malaysia is a good partner, there could be some break in the level of tariffs.

""These are very early days. We don't know which direction they are going to go. And a lot of times the tariffs will not necessarily be direct; it's not necessarily a direct negotiation. There are other factors in play. We will have to wait and see how the whole relationship develops,"" Siobhan said.

Earlier during the programme, she said bilateral ties between the US and Malaysia had been constantly resilient on the back of diverse economic relationships between both countries.

She noted that the Malaysian government right now was being extremely pragmatic, and it was taking the right approach in understanding what the US needs, and trying to formulate what is the offering for a business match.

“And that is very pragmatic, and I congratulate the government for doing that. But I think there are things that we could be doing ourselves.

“It is what we can do on the ground here to make ourselves more competitive, to actually understand what we have in Malaysia, and to make sure that we are focused on those high-value areas, so that we are bringing the right investments into the right sectors, lowering the attrition rate,"" Siobhan said.",1.74612E+12,en,0.507548392,2025-05-01 02:45:33,"['beyond', 'time', 'direct', 'sector', 'early', 'critical', 'massive', 'high', 'perfectly', 'including', 'amount', 'understand', 'commerce', 'whole', 'administration', 'electronics', 'space', 'influx', 'export', 'continue', 'break', 'medical', 'trade', 'ict', 'amcham', 'continuation', 'dont', 'largest', 'officer', 'going', 'probably', 'collaboration', 'direction', 'diverse', 'lumpur', 'investment', 'rollback', 'last', 'invest', 'coming', 'course', 'think', 'extremely', 'year', 'required', 'grow', 'performance', 'programme', 'value', 'may', 'added', 'reaching', 'member', 'negotiation', 'placed', 'question', 'malaysian', 'could', 'come', 'taking', 'presence', 'congratulate', 'opportunity', 'economic', 'also', 'area', 'good', 'constantly', 'equipped', 'siobhan', 'bringing', 'wednesday', 'pragmatic', 'attracting', 'working', 'business', 'one', 'sure', 'factor', 'mineral', 'convey', 'know', 'earlier', 'aerospace', 'significant', 'datuk', 'strength', 'focused', 'make', 'providing', 'technology', 'well', 'investor', 'amchams', 'competitive', 'tie', 'see', 'chemical', 'lowering', 'uschina', 'future', 'relationship', 'tension', 'record', 'play', 'looking', 'tariff', 'resilient', 'malaysiaus', 'trying', 'interview', 'noted', 'traditional', 'nation', 'accounted', 'surging', 'exponentially', 'jessy', 'guest', 'sustained', 'building', 'information', 'bernama', 'entitled', 'electrical', 'need', 'attracted', 'attrition', 'semiconductor', 'country', 'amid', 'ability', 'deliver', 'rose', 'highvalue', 'focus', 'foresee', 'able', 'thing', 'understanding', 'lot', 'asked', 'executive', 'chahal', 'report', 'company', 'approach', 'ground', 'attractiveness', 'five', 'interest', 'remain', 'develops', 'right', 'total', 'according', 'compared', 'specialty', 'partner', 'kuala', 'part', 'government', 'relation', 'formulate', 'wait', 'gather', 'communication', 'growing', 'rate', 'day', 'offering', 'paramount', 'came', 'chamber', 'hosted', 'consistently', 'chief', 'whether', 'still', 'back', 'industry', 'land', 'malaysia', 'match', 'said', 'bilateral', 'level', 'currently', 'landed', 'billion', 'quality', 'seen', 'new', 'necessarily', 'told', 'american', 'actually']",Positive

When Trump announced his ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs on 5 April, among those countries initially set to receive the highest tariffs were many that are counted among the ASEAN bloc (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), including Vietnam (46 percent), Laos (48 percent), Myanmar (44 percent) and Cambodia (49 percent) with Malaysia on 24 percent.

The logic was clear. These are among the countries in the world with the highest trade surpluses with the US, their entire economies being oriented towards exports and highly dependent on the US market. These sky-high tariffs may have been paused, but it is clear that in one way or another, Trump is also gunning for them. And tariff pauses notwithstanding, Malaysia and other ASEAN countries have still been slapped with 10 percent tariffs. The US-China trade war is putting the capitalist model of Malaysia to the test, and preparing massive instability in the region.

The Malaysian capitalist model in crisis

The turbulence in world capitalism and the US-China trade war are presenting a dilemma for the Malaysian ruling class. In the past they have benefited from ASEAN’s trademark ‘neutrality’ and ‘non-alignment’, that is, maintaining economic and political relations with both China and the US.

This is critical for the functioning of Malaysia's capitalist model. Like most of the ASEAN economies, it is heavily reliant on an export-oriented manufacturing sector. Trade is vastly important for the country’s economy. The trade to GDP ratio of Malaysia in 2023 was 130 percent. Much of its growth over the past two decades was due to the pouring of foreign investment, largely from the US, Europe, and China, into this sector. In fact, the ASEAN area is one of the most trade-dependent regions of the world, with trade to GDP ratios of 300 percent in Singapore, 166 percent in Vietnam and 144 percent in Cambodia.

Cheap labour costs relative to the advanced capitalist world, and its strategic location near the Malacca Strait, an important artery in world trade, allowed Malaysia to be a jumping off platform for investment into the rest of the Southeast Asian market.

Malaysia's dependence on American investment and markets can be seen with its electrical and electronics industry, which was built by American companies such as Intel and AMD from the 1970s. This industry now accounts for nearly 40 percent of Malaysia’s total exports, much of it going to the United States.

Likewise, large amounts of Chinese capital have flowed into Malaysia especially since the 2010s – in chipmaking, renewable energy, EV manufacturing, etc. China has also been Malaysia’s largest trading partner since 2009, and is its second largest foreign investor, if one includes investments from Hong Kong.

Steady growth in world trade and a relative stability of US-China relations have allowed economic growth based on this delicate balancing act. In fact, even with the beginning of the trade war in 2018, the ASEAN economies benefited as foreign companies invested in them to avoid dependence on China, in what was known as the ‘China+1’ strategy. However, the intensification of the trade war has turned this balancing act into a weakness.

The Malaysian capitalist class is reluctant to lean too close to any one imperialist power, lest they lose investments and market access from the other. Other ASEAN economies like Thailand and Vietnam, also being reliant on the same export-oriented model, face the same dilemma.

Already, China has taken the opportunity after Trump’s tariffs announcement to present itself as a more reliable and predictable partner for Malaysia and ASEAN than the US. That was the main message of Xi’s visit to Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia that immediately followed Trump’s announcement. But while welcoming a strengthening of ties with China, the Malaysian ruling class are anxious that it does not come at the expense of relations with the US. In short, the ASEAN economies are forced into an impossible position to choose between the two imperialist powers.

Until recently, some had held the vague hope that the ASEAN trade bloc could form the basis of something like a European Union of South East Asia, that by drawing together politically as well as economically, it could assert something of an independent line.

The crisis of the European Union shows that that model hardly offers rosy prospects anymore. But even that level of unity isn’t possible for the ASEAN countries. Unlike the EU, which has Germany and France at its core as medium-sized imperialist powers holding it together, there is no major power at the core of ASEAN that could give it cohesion. There is therefore no common policy among the ASEAN bloc, with some leaning more towards the US and others more towards China.

The Singaporean capitalists have attempted to play something of an imperialist role in the local region, and have some ambitions of becoming the dominant force within ASEAN, exporting capital that is invested in other ASEAN economies. However, their position is itself dependent on the openness of a globalised world economy, with Singaporean capital taking advantage of being a clearing house for both American and Chinese capital. This position is becoming more precarious.

As trade barriers go up and capital withdraws its tentacles behind national barriers, the whole bloc is enormously exposed.

For now they are attempting to resist and find some sort of solution. Hence the ASEAN leaders ruled out retaliatory tariffs, and jointly preferred negotiation with the US and the maintenance of the status quo. But if the US-China conflict continues to intensify, this position of facing both ways will become more and more untenable, with dire consequences for their economies.

Can China save Malaysian capitalism?

To weather the impact of these tensions, the Malaysian ruling class is scrambling to diversify its partnerships. On the one hand, they are trying to draw closer to other powers such as the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), the EU, and Russia. On the other hand, they are seeking to tighten up relations with other ASEAN member states – encouraging more regional trade and investment. But these small, relatively backward economies cannot survive on their own, and at the end of the day this does not solve their problems.

There are those among the ruling class that do indeed see China as a saviour of Malaysian capitalism. There is a growing realisation among the ruling classes of Malaysia and ASEAN that China is the most influential economic power in the region.

According to a 2025 report by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, which surveyed ASEAN business elites and government officials, “China remains the most influential economic (56.4%) and political-strategic (37.9%) power in the region, outpacing the US by significant margins,” although with smaller margins than last year.

In response to the question “If ASEAN were forced to align itself with one of the strategic rivals [the US or China], which should it choose?”, Malaysian respondents clearly chose China for the second year running (70.8 percent in 2025 and 75.1 percent in 2024). But for the ruling classes of ASEAN as a whole, the picture is more divided, with 47.7 percent favouring China and 52.3 percent favouring the US, a similarly even split to last year.

But closer relations with China are not without its problems. There is still the prospect of cheap Chinese goods flooding the country and destroying domestic industries, especially as Chinese overproduction worsens and America’s tariffs remain. Indonesia had already fallen victim to this ‘dumping’, with 80,000 workers in its textile industry being laid off last year because of competition with China. Similarly, nearly 2,000 factories closed down in Thailand in 2023. Vietnam also fell prey to an influx of Chinese steel and aluminium.

The ASEAN economies are nowhere near able to compete with the vast productivity of China. Some have already implemented or are mulling protectionist measures against this onslaught – Vietnam, for instance, has applied an anti-dumping tariff on Chinese steel, and Indonesia has considered up to 200 percent tariffs on certain Chinese goods.

Even before the latest trade war, some were pulling towards China, others towards the US. Trump’s belligerent tariff policy can push the ruling classes to build closer relations with China, but the other side of the equation is that now the Chinese have lost access to the US market, fears of competition from Chinese commodities being diverted and dumped on ASEAN markets will grow. The relationships between the ruling classes of the region and China are thus contradictory and it is by no means easy to foresee in which direction they will be pushed.

Attacks on the working class

The outcome of these shifts in world relations cannot be predicted with certainty. But whatever that outcome is, there are no good tidings for Malaysian capitalism.

The general uncertainty over the world economy is not favourable for continued foreign investment into Malaysia. Foreign capitalists will think twice before investing in a country that can, at any moment, be slapped with higher tariffs by the US. This is especially true of businesses that manufacture products specifically to be shipped back to the US, such as the semiconductors industry, which make up 25 percent of Malaysian GDP.

As such, a boom similar to the 1990s or a period of steady growth as before, borne of high foreign investment and increasing world trade, is increasingly unlikely.

Many had dreamed that the ASEAN economies were destined to follow the road of China. Large amounts of foreign investment had enormously developed China, leading to a rise in living standards and the growth of a powerful domestic capitalist class. The hope was that, as ASEAN attracted foreign capital – partly as an alternative to China with capital being relocated for strategic reasons, and partly thanks to lower labour costs as wages rose in China – this would assist in developing powerful economies in this region.

But as protectionist tendencies have risen as a result of the organic crisis of world capitalism, these hopes have been dashed. Even if the higher rate of Trump’s reciprocal tariffs are not resumed, a 10 percent blanket tariff is enough to raise prices substantially. At the end of the day the burden of these tariffs will be pushed onto the shoulders of the working class in the form of higher prices and through job losses as capital relocates.

The bourgeoisie will attempt to attack wages to maintain their profits as their products become less competitive on the world stage. Other businesses that cannot compete will close down factories and throw workers on the scrapheap. Already Chinese solar panel manufacturers have packed up and left over the new tariffs imposed by the US, with rates reaching as high as 250 percent. The exit of Chinese companies over last year’s tariffs have put 5,000 workers at risk.

Intensification of the class struggle

Growth rates only tell one side of the story. Despite the steady growth of 3 to 5 percent since the pandemic, the conditions of the working class in Malaysia are worsening, as they are elsewhere. The cost of food and basic necessities, which ballooned in recent years, have not come down to any livable level for wide sections of the population.

Anwar Ibrahim’s unity government, as representatives of the ruling class, has carried out cuts on top of this cost of living crisis. This period of economic uncertainty will only add to the discontent against the Pakatan Harapan government, which is already under pressure from several fronts, as we have written before.

This stormy period for world capitalism will exacerbate the political and social turmoil in Malaysia and the whole region. This instability will only propel class struggle forward, as we have seen in the form of mass struggles erupting in recent years, most recently in Indonesia. The masses everywhere are looking for a way out of the crisis, and they are learning from each other across national divides.

But what is needed is Marxist ideas and leadership for the struggling masses, and Ombak Revolusi is constructing just that in Malaysia as a part of a Southeast Asian and world struggle for socialist

export,"Cover Story: Auto stocks in low gear, but don’t count them out yet",1.74608E+12,The Edge Malaysia,theedgemalaysia.com,https://news.google.com/read/CBMiUEFVX3lxTE84eTlwLTJQUEpzTnh2VmdHRm5peFpacEdMOVpRWHBQZUNtN2V5SDNEdHJfbkN0TGRaMGhVSVZydEQ5MnVoMUV2a0NmODM4djhp?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/752448,"This article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly on April 21, 2025 - April 27, 2025

AUTOMOTIVE stocks on Bursa Malaysia have largely flown under the radar of investors in recent years, weighed down by persistent challenges in the sector. Most listed players have recorded sharp share price declines over the past year, reflecting the earnings pressure and muted sentiment.

Tan Chong Motor Holdings Bhd (KL:TCHONG), DRB-Hicom Bhd (KL:DRBHCOM) and Bermaz Auto Bhd (KL:BAUTO) have seen their share prices fall 66.3%, 49.5% and 46.8% respectively over the past year, mirroring the steep contractions in earnings or — in Tan Chong Motor’s case — continued losses.

Sime Darby Bhd’s (KL:SIME) share price has dipped 16.4%, as it posted a 58.97% drop in net profit over the last 12 months. Oriental Holdings Bhd (KL:ORIENT) and MBM Resources Bhd (KL:MBMR), however, bucked the trend, recording net profit growth of 27.96% and 0.53% respectively. Nevertheless, only MBM saw a notable share price gain of 24.7%.

Hap Seng Consolidated Bhd (KL:HAPSENG), a key Mercedes-Benz dealer, saw its share price fall 38.4% amid an 18.7% decline in net profit. Valuation-wise, all the counters except DRB-Hicom are trading at single-digit or near single-digit historical price-earnings ratios (PERs), reflecting the cautious investor sentiment. Bermaz Auto and MBM appear particularly cheap, trading at PERs of 5.7 times and 6.5 times respectively, compared with DRB-Hicom’s 56.6 times — likely inflated by earnings compression.

Despite the tepid investor interest, a few auto counters may warrant a second look for their resilient earnings and diversified exposure.

In an April 4 report, Kenanga Research maintains its “overweight” call on the automotive sector. The research house estimates that the national marques will expand their market dominance to 62% of the total industry volume (TIV) in 2025, compared with 58% in 2022, due to increasing demand for affordable vehicles, displacing the market share of foreign marques.

“Although we make no changes to our TIV forecast, we believe the heavyweights under our coverage are experiencing a valuation derating due to intense competition in the non-national space. If such pressures persist, such as with more foreign brands’ localisation programmes, this may also weigh on the valuations of others, such as Sime Darby, for which we have lowered the PER valuation to 12 times [from 14 times], reducing our target price by 14% to RM2.50 [from RM2.90],” says Kenanga Research.

However, the research house maintains Sime Darby’s “outperform” rating as it is still a proxy to the national marques via its 38% stake in Perusahaan Otomobil Kedua Sdn Bhd (Perodua).

Kenanga Research’s 2025 forecast for new vehicle sales in Malaysia, or TIV, at 805,000 units (-2% year on year) is a tad above the Malaysian Automotive Association’s (MAA) projection of 780,000 (-4.4%), backed by strong sustained demand in the affordable segment and attractive new launches.

The research house observes a downtrading trend among mid-market buyers and forward buying interest on the deferment of new excise duty regulations to end-2025, of which Perodua is anticipated to benefit the most.

MBM and Hong Leong Industries Bhd (KL:HLIND) are Kenanga Research’s sector picks, being good proxies to the affordable vehicle market and fuel subsidy rationalisation programme. Moreover, the two counters offer attractive dividend yields of about 8% and 5% respectively.

Chinese EV wave

During the tabling of Budget 2024 in parliament, the Malaysian government proposed an import and excise duty exemption for imported electric vehicles (EVs) until Dec 31, 2025, and until Dec 31, 2027, for locally assembled EVs.

Notably, Chinese carmakers, including BYD Co Ltd and Chery Automobile Co Ltd, have been expanding aggressively in Southeast Asia, intensifying competition for local players such as Bermaz Auto and Tan Chong Motor. For perspective, Bermaz Auto currently has a smaller market share of 1%, whereas Chery’s market share stands at 4%.

Are Malaysian-listed auto players doing enough to defend their market share and stay competitive, or is further erosion of their market position inevitable? Malacca Securities research head Loui Low Ley Yee believes the Chinese carmakers are perceived as providing cutting-edge technology at affordable prices, giving local manufacturers a run for their money.

“In order to be competitive and defend their market share, local carmakers either need to have a more competitive price point or adopt the current trend on EVs and rebrand with some enhanced technological shift to attract consumers,” he tells The Edge.

Low thinks local car manufacturers, namely Proton Holdings Bhd and Perodua, have quite a decent price range and product offerings for both cars with internal combustion engines (ICEs) and EVs.

“The Chinese carmakers flooded our market with their recent offerings, while Bermaz Auto was being targeted, causing its car sales to decline. We believe this trend could persist if Chinese carmakers continue to offer a decent price range with high-end technological gadgets in cars,” he reckons.

Apex Securities head of research Kenneth Leong notes that some efforts have been made by certain Malaysian-listed firms, such as tying up with the Chinese EV makers to leverage the growing EV market. Local players are also on track to launch their own EV models.

For example, Sime Darby’s automotive arm Sime Darby Motors Sdn Bhd is forging a partnership with Chinese EV manufacturer BYD, DRB-Hicom with Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co Ltd, Warisan TC Holdings Bhd (sister company of Tan Chong Motor) with GAC AION New Energy Automobile Co Ltd, and Bermaz Auto with XPeng.

“Once the Proton and Perodua EVs — set to be launched later this year — take off, we expect local automotive makers to grab a slice of the EV market,” he tells The Edge.

Short-term pressures to persist

BIMB Securities automotive analyst Sabariah Mohamad Akhair concurs that local players, such as Bermaz Auto and Tan Chong Motor, have made significant strides in defending their market positions.

“Both companies have introduced EV line-ups to align with evolving market trends, ensuring they remain competitive in the growing EV segment. In addition, these players continue to prioritise enhancing the customer experience and after-sales service, which remains a strong differentiator,” she tells The Edge.

Sabariah points out that while Chinese brands tend to emphasise advanced interior features, local players focus more on offering a balanced approach, particularly safety features.

“Although we anticipate some continued decline in market share in the near term due to increasing competition from Chinese brands, we believe Bermaz Auto and Tan Chong Motor have laid the foundation for long-term stability. Their focus on customer loyalty, after-sales service and strategic product diversification will likely help them maintain competitiveness in the future,” she says.

While the share prices of many locally listed automotive players have dropped and continue to face short-term pressures, Sabariah says this presents an opportunity for investors looking to enter at a lower price point.

“Under our coverage, we like companies like Bermaz Auto, MBM Resources and Sime Darby, which have strong fundamentals, particularly in dividend performance. These companies have shown a solid track record in delivering consistent returns to shareholders, making them attractive for long-term investors,” she says.

Apex Securities’ Leong expects investor interest to emerge in certain key automotive players. For example, DRB-Hicom and MBM Resources command strong market share in the local automotive industry, while having established partnerships with reputable Chinese EV players.

“The upcoming launch of local EV models will eventually cement their position as top players in the automotive market. Our top pick is MBM Resources, with a ‘buy’ rating and target price of RM6.54, on the back of Perodua’s market leadership and steady demand, which will support vehicle sales, while benefiting from the launch of the latter’s EV model, namely eMO-II, tentatively in the fourth quarter of 2025,” he says.

Impact of US tariffs

On April 3, US President Donald Trump imposed a blanket reciprocal tariff of 24% on goods imported from Malaysia, compared with 36% for Thailand and 32% for Indonesia. These tariffs were supposed to come into effect on April 9 but have now been paused for three months.

However, there is no pause on the 25% tariff on automotive imports, which went into effect on April 3, as well as on automotive parts, which will take effect on May 3.

Trump’s 25% automotive tariff is reportedly estimated to cover more than US$460 billion (RM2 trillion) worth of imports of vehicles and auto parts annually. There will be a levy on vehicles made in Mexico and Canada, but automakers compliant with the terms of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement can deduct the value of US content.

Interestingly, in the 2025 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers published on March 31, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) highlighted Malaysia’s automotive approved permit (AP) system as a discriminatory non-tariff barrier.

Now, how would Trump’s 24% reciprocal tariff — although on pause for now — as well as the 25% automotive tariff affect Malaysia’s automotive industry? And how should policymakers or industry players respond, especially with the risk of broader trade repercussions?

Malacca Securities’ Low points out that the US singling out Malaysia’s AP system and the 24% reciprocal tariff underscore the need for strategic recalibration to safeguard the automotive industry’s growth while addressing trade concerns. “Currently, with the pause on the reciprocal tariff, we believe all policymakers and business corporates will adopt a wait-and-see stance until further clarity is provided,” he says.

According to Datuk Hanafi Sakri, deputy secretary-general (industry) at the Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry, the trade gap in Malaysia’s automotive sector has persisted for over 40 years. In 2024, imports totalling RM54.33 billion far exceeded the RM15.96 billion in gross exports of motor vehicles, motorcycles, and parts and components, resulting in a trade deficit of RM38.37 billion for Malaysia.

“Given the 24% reciprocal tariff [being paused for 90 days] by the US, it may position us more favourably against Thailand and Indonesia, which are being viewed as the two largest vehicle manufacturers in the region as Trump imposed higher tariffs on them,” he points out.

Low urges policymakers to proactively pursue bilateral agreements — particularly in Asean, the Middle East and Africa — to reduce reliance on any single market and mitigate the US trade risks. “Policymakers could foster public-private partnerships to navigate tariff impacts, such as optimising Asean-centric production networks or leveraging free trade agreements, such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), to mitigate the US market risks,” he suggests.

Apex Securities’ Leong says the impact of US tariffs could be minimal as most of Malaysia’s vehicle exports are to Asean countries such as Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei and Indonesia, which collectively amounted to 83.9% of the total Malaysian vehicle export value of RM1.56 billion.

Nonetheless, it is timely for policymakers to revamp the National Automotive Policy (NAP) to recognise the transition to EVs, as well as to reduce the excise duty on locally assembled cars that will take effect in 2026, in order to make the local auto manufacturing sector more competitive.

BIMB’s Sabariah acknowledges that the recent inclusion of Malaysia’s automotive AP system in the US 2025 National Trade Estimate Report, alongside the imposition of a 24% reciprocal tariff, poses potential challenges for Malaysia’s automotive sector.

“While the direct impact on vehicle exports to the US is limited due to the relatively low volume of such exports, the primary concern revolves around auto parts suppliers. These manufacturers are likely to face increased costs, which could reduce export volumes to the US,” she says.

“In turn, this may lead to a reconfiguration of supply chains, with the American companies potentially seeking alternative suppliers from regions with more favourable trade conditions,” she points out, adding that policymakers will need to review and reform the AP system to enhance transparency and align it with international trade norms.

“This would help reduce the perception of discrimination and protect Malaysia’s competitiveness in the global automotive sector. For industry players, the focus should shift towards diversifying export markets, especially in regions where trade barriers are lower, and investing in product innovation to maintain a competitive edge,” says Sabariah.

By Vietnam News Agency Tue, April 29, 2025 | 10:27 pm GMT+7

Malaysia successfully maintained its position as the ninth-largest exporter of high-tech goods out of 143 countries worldwide in 2023, the highest recognition it has achieved in the past decade, national news agency Bernama reported.

At the launch of the Malaysia High Technology Performance Report 2023, Datuk Seri Hasnol Zam Zam Ahmad, secretary-general of the Malaysian Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI), said that Malaysia’s high-tech exports increased by $2 billion to reach $127 billion in 2023.

He said high-tech exports comprised 58.69% of total manufacturing exports in 2023, up from 52.48% recorded in 2022.

He also noted that the country recorded its highest trade surplus in a decade, totalling $51.5 billion.

Measuring the value of Malaysia’s high-tech exports is not an easy task, he said. First and foremost, the definition of ‘high technology’ must comply with international standards, including those set by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the World Bank.

Hasnol Zam Zam emphasized MOSTI’s commitment to expanding and strengthening the national innovation ecosystem to ensure sustained competitiveness across all development sectors, especially in high technology.

In addition, he mentioned that several international institutions also use high-tech export indicators as a key measure to assess a country’s competitiveness and innovation capacity.",1.74604E+12,en,0.387714028,2025-04-29 15:27:54,"['sector', 'across', 'comprised', 'organisation', 'definition', 'high', 'including', 'measuring', 'bank', 'exporter', 'cooperation', 'secretarygeneral', 'addition', 'advice', 'task', 'export', 'successfully', 'decade', 'trade', 'seri', 'surplus', 'zam', 'past', 'mostis', 'largest', 'use', 'recognition', 'courtesy', 'totalling', 'highest', 'world', 'performance', 'must', 'value', 'ninthlargest', 'gmt', 'strengthening', 'malaysian', 'international', 'economic', 'also', 'career', 'area', 'good', 'key', 'remains', 'science', 'especially', 'easy', 'ministry', 'commitment', 'achieved', 'hightech', 'datuk', 'set', 'expanding', 'view', 'increased', 'technology', 'position', 'oecd', 'news', 'worldwide', 'standard', 'mosti', 'product', 'agency', 'ahmad', 'emphasized', 'maintained', 'noted', 'development', 'sustained', 'global', 'measure', 'manufacturing', 'bernama', 'first', 'country', 'comply', 'hasnol', 'aeria', 'ensure', 'innovation', 'capacity', 'ecosystem', 'vietnam', 'reported', 'report', 'national', 'total', 'tue', 'institution', 'competitiveness', 'recorded', 'foremost', 'mentioned', 'assess', 'reach', 'april', 'several', 'malaysia', 'said', 'photo', 'indicator', 'billion', 'launch']",Neutral

KUALA LUMPUR : The Global South must forge a new path and take the lead in reshaping international cooperation as the stability and security of the world economy are being actively undermined by the current international system, says foreign minister Mohamad Hasan.

Speaking at the BRICS Partners Foreign Ministers Meeting 2025 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Tuesday, he said the flurry of tariffs which had sent shockwaves through the global community was not a threat, but a revelation and an opportunity.

He said the Global South, as a collective, was becoming a key actor in global realignment and must not be content with a passive role in global decision-making.

“This is an opportunity to reshape international cooperation in ways that reflect our strengths and better serve our needs.

“We must be proactive, forward-looking, and united in shaping a cooperative, just world order. Malaysia stands ready to work with BRICS and all partners who share this vision,” he said at a dedicated session called “The Role of the Global South in Reinforcing Multilateralism”.

Citing Asean as the world’s fifth-largest economy with a combined GDP of US$3.8 trillion, he said the region offered significant purchasing power, strong export performance, and open-minded diplomacy.

Mohamad said that with this emerging role in mind, Malaysia, as this year’s Asean chair, was guiding the region towards unity, economic cohesion, and strategic diversification.

“Through our commitment to an open, rules-based, and inclusive regional architecture, Asean is focused on strengthening intra-regional trade, developing resilient supply chains, and embracing emerging industries that place sustainability and innovation at their core,” he said.

He said that BRICS, too, was a force for economic resilience, political balance, and social advancement.

Wyze says it paid $255,000 with import fees to ship just $167,000 worth of product.

On Wednesday, Wyze posted a screenshot of a shipment receipt. ""Just got our first tariff bill. We imported $167k of floodlights and then paid $255k in tariffs. That’s more than any of our founders were paid last year,” the Seattle-based company tweeted.

Although Wyze didn't break down how the import fee was calculated, $255,000 suggests the company is paying Trump’s 145% tariffs on Chinese imports. Last month, Trump imposed an extra 125% tariff on Chinese imports on top of 20% fees announced earlier this year.

To avoid these hefty tariffs in the future, Wyze says it's ""been working on moving manufacturing out of China for over a year now, but those efforts have been…accelerated. We’ll probably be out in 60 days.” This includes migrating its factories to Vietnam and Malaysia, where Trump’s ""reciprocal tariffs"" have been paused for 90 days.

Wyze’s tweets have drawn backlash from some users who fault the company for not sourcing its products from US factories. “Tariffs are clearly working. Your first mistake was manufacturing in China,” said one X user. Others indicate they plan on boycotting Wyze products.

Wyze was not having it, telling critics it relies on suppliers in Asia, “mostly because it's way less expensive to do so and allows us to sell for lower prices. Also, I hope you don't use an iphone, use a computer, wear Nikes, or buy Legos cause if you do I have bad news for you...""

Wyze adds that it was forced to import the Chinese-assembled floodlights and pay the $255,000 import fees due to a prior commitment with a retailer.

""We fully committed this inventory to a retailer in February, and it has to get to them in May for a promo they are running in June. I’m sure they will be totally fine when we call and tell them it won’t get there until 2028 and it now costs $529 because we didn’t dabble in idiocy,"" it tweeted.

Wyze has suspended shipments to the US on other shipments to avoid high tariffs. But in the long term, the company might need to raise prices. “We're going to wait to see what happens in the next few weeks,” the vendor told one user who asked about potential price hikes.",1.74621E+12,en,-0.532360733,2025-05-01 17:46:31,"['ship', 'telling', 'china', 'high', 'inventory', 'wear', 'import', 'mostly', 'way', 'say', 'fee', 'founder', 'fault', 'migrating', 'dabble', 'electronics', 'screenshot', 'critic', 'vendor', 'break', 'clearly', 'iphone', 'sell', 'dont', 'running', 'committed', 'use', 'going', 'probably', 'backlash', 'plan', 'june', 'hefty', 'tell', 'factory', 'hitting', 'month', 'last', 'avoid', 'fully', 'suspended', 'others', 'year', 'hike', 'worth', 'idiocy', 'term', 'may', 'hope', 'wont', 'retailer', 'asia', 'drawn', 'trump', 'realworld', 'tweeted', 'pay', 'moving', 'also', 'buy', 'call', 'forced', 'shipment', 'mistake', 'extra', 'wednesday', 'working', 'although', 'promo', 'one', 'potential', 'chinese', 'tweet', 'sure', 'earlier', 'long', 'commitment', 'might', 'announced', 'less', 'didnt', 'boycotting', 'prior', 'receipt', 'well', 'allows', 'bad', 'news', 'calculated', 'see', 'lower', 'future', 'product', 'sourcing', 'tariff', 'get', 'raise', 'effort', 'cost', 'paused', 'manufacturing', 'first', 'need', 'price', 'relies', 'chineseassembled', 'totally', 'beenaccelerated', 'lego', 'indicate', 'example', 'wyze', 'posted', 'expensive', 'nike', 'vietnam', 'got', 'suggests', 'happens', 'week', 'asked', 'company', 'imported', 'wyzes', 'add', 'floodlight', 'imposed', 'cause', 'thats', 'february', 'wait', 'reciprocal', 'day', 'includes', 'next', 'top', 'user', 'supplier', 'due', 'industry', 'malaysia', 'paid', 'said', 'paying', 'seattlebased', 'fine', 'told', 'computer', 'bill']",Negative

President Osmani Sadriu, who arrived yesterday, was formally welcomed with an official ceremony at the Perdana Putra Complex earlier today.

Malaysia was among the earliest Asian countries to recognise Kosovo’s independence on 30 October 2008, with formal diplomatic relations established on March 18, 2011.

Anwar reiterated Malaysia’s commitment to working with Kosovo beyond traditional diplomatic ties, seeking broader collaboration across multiple sectors.

“I look forward to more engagements other than the technical cooperation with Kosovo. But please be assured, President, that we don't treat this as an ordinary diplomatic engagement, but to give you this commitment that Malaysia is a true friend,” he said.

He also confirmed that Malaysia would resume bilateral consultations at the official level soon to ensure the smooth implementation of programmes, projects, and initiatives related to economic and trade relations.

During their meeting, both leaders also exchanged views on global affairs.

Anwar said, “Both leaders shared a strong belief in independence, human rights, and respect for human dignity,” noting they discussed a wide range of international issues, including the situation in Palestine and broader efforts to promote peace across the globe.

Reflecting on the enduring connection between the two countries, Anwar recalled Malaysia’s long-standing support for Kosovo’s journey to independence and stability.

(BASF pic)

FRANKFURT : German chemicals giant BASF stuck to its 2025 earnings outlook today, despite the turmoil unleashed by hardline US trade policies, but warned of high levels of uncertainty.

The company, a crucial supplier for the automobile, agriculture and construction sectors, said it was “more resilient than others” when it came to US tariffs due to its focus on producing locally.

“In the US, more than 80% of the group’s sales came from products manufactured in the country,” it said.

But the group warned: “The volatility of the tariff announcements and the unpredictability of other decisions by the US, as well as possible countermeasures by trading partners, are causing a high level of uncertainty”.

CFO Dirk Elvermann said BASF had to consider indirect impacts of tariffs due to potential changes in demand in industries such as automotive and consumer goods.

“It was currently hard to assess the full impact,” he added.

Despite the uncertainty, BASF maintained its outlook for 2025, forecasting earnings before special items (EBITDA) of between €8 billion and €8.4 billion (US$9.1 billion and US$9.5 billion) for 2025.

US President Donald Trump has unleashed a barrage of tariffs on allies and adversaries alike.

Apart from on China, the highest levies have been paused for now to allow for talks with trading partners – but a baseline 10% tariff is still in effect.

BASF also reported today a 40% fall in first quarter (Q1) net profits to €808 million.

The group blamed the drop, which was slightly worse than expected, on rising competition.

Sales were down around 1% from a year earlier at €17.4 billion.

The chemicals sector in Europe’s biggest economy has been hit hard in recent years due to higher energy costs in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and weaker demand in key markets such as China.

agriculture,'Anticipate the Worst': Minister Says Rice Exports on Hold Despite Record-High Reserves,1.74619E+12,Tempo.co English,en.tempo.co,https://news.google.com/read/CBMi9wFBVV95cUxOUEhtb2hSNWI5RXBfc0FHNkpEWUFTZWQzVWN0NU1TY2U1empQTFA2YVZpNWNvYlhPbTdnNDYxeVpHZGVLdlNjQkNvLVNLNlVNTl9NY00tb0VKRXg1WTg4ZXY5TjdRUmZJZnoyZjFoWVJqVWtBeUYtZlFjWHRVUi1fSW9uYVVVd296dy11bUpfT2h3TlVpd2staE16VHVCZXkzUkYxbHdJLXpQaXJ1eWNWMW5LRXBQelN4S0pwblJiQTRMc0JyQlVCU0tndkZ1WmpXQ2tCSTZId1V5Q29zWnp0Y244VFB2WVdaaVBKZW54NkdCZjhxLVBr?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://en.tempo.co/read/2002915/anticipate-the-worst-minister-says-rice-exports-on-hold-despite-record-high-reserves?utm_source=Digital%20Marketing&utm_medium=Babe,"TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Minister of Agriculture Amran Sulaiman emphasized that boosting national rice reserves remains the government's top priority before allowing rice exports, even as production surges and stock levels reach 3.18 million tons.

""We need to ensure the strength of our stock first,"" Amran stated during a National Coordination Meeting with 37,000 agricultural extension workers, as quoted by Antara on April 27, 2025.

Amran’s remarks responded to President Prabowo Subianto’s earlier statement signaling openness to rice exports due to production surplus. Amran made clear that exports would only be considered once domestic supply is fully secure, especially in the face of unpredictable climate change impacts on global food production.

""What's important is that we have enough domestically. We need to ensure our sufficiency, and if necessary, we need to ensure it's more than sufficient. Why? Because the climate is unpredictable,"" he added.

Amran warned about extreme weather risks, citing food crises in Japan, Malaysia, and the Philippines as cautionary examples. He asserted that Indonesia is making significant strides toward food self-sufficiency, with national food security becoming a key priority in an increasingly volatile global environment.

""We need to anticipate the worst. We must not let what happened to Japan, Malaysia, and the Philippines happen here,"" said Amran.

President Prabowo earlier gave approval for rice exports to several countries, citing abundant production. He didn’t specify destinations, but Malaysia has expressed interest in buying Indonesian rice.

""I received reports from the Minister of Agriculture, the Minister of Food Affairs, several countries asked us to send them rice. I permit it! And I instruct that we send them rice,"" Prabowo declared during the launch of the Indonesian Planting Movement (Gerina) in Banyuasin, South Sumatra, on April 23, 2025.

He also stressed that exports, if necessary, should prioritize humanitarian needs over profit.

""If needed, based on humanitarian grounds, we should not seek excessive profits. What's important is production costs, plus transportation (distribution), and administrative costs. We prove that Indonesia is no longer a nation that begs, but a nation that can help and give to other nations,"" Prabowo said.

Indonesia's Rice Stock Hits Historic High

Minister Amran noted that the current rice stock, at 3.18 million tons, is the highest in 23 years--possibly the highest since independence.

He also reported that national rice production increased by 50-62 percent from January to April 2025, based on data from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS). Amran considered this a remarkable achievement amid regional food crises and price hikes.

""At this moment, we have a surplus (of rice), while friendly countries, neighboring countries like Malaysia, the Philippines, and Japan are having food difficulties. This is our pride,"" he said.

President Prabowo’s long-standing push for food self-sufficiency was reiterated at a Cabinet Plenary Session in December 2024, where he expressed optimism that Indonesia would not need to import rice in 2025.

""And it is very likely and I firmly believe that in 2025, we will not import rice again,"" he said.

Deputy Minister Sudaryono also reported a 2.8 to 3 million ton surplus as of April 2025 compared to the previous year.

The National Food Agency (Bapanas) has credited Indonesia’s import ban policy with contributing to a drop in global rice prices. According to agency head Arief Prasetyo Adi, rice prices fell from US$640 to near US$400 per metric ton, due in part to Indonesia’s reduced reliance on imports.

Meanwhile, Amran revealed that some rice-exporting countries were unhappy with Indonesia’s rising production, as it limited their export markets.

""Yesterday, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) said that rice production in Indonesia has jumped significantly, and their words were disappointing for exporters from other countries,"" said Amran.

agriculture,China’s durian imports from Malaysia to rise 15-20% in 2025 on strong demand — MayCham,1.74619E+12,The Edge Malaysia,theedgemalaysia.com,https://news.google.com/read/CBMiU0FVX3lxTFBLRV81MUtwZmoyUWVONURkUnI1aFNpNi1WMkJ2VTZkRDVFU1pUNjhacGdyQkxLamYyeGFJaHdjWXVEdWd0R050eW9FNVNKdFBCN3dV?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/753827,"BEIJING (May 2): The volume of China’s durian imports from Malaysia is expected to increase by between 15 and 20% this year, driven by sustained consumer demand despite recent weather-related challenges in Malaysia, according to the Malaysia Chamber of Commerce and Industry in China (MayCham).

Its chairman Loh Wee Keng said demand from Chinese consumers continues to outpace supply, particularly for premium varieties such as Musang King and D24.

“Although heavy rain in Malaysia caused some fruits to drop prematurely, I foresee the overall export volume this year to be 15 to 20% higher compared with last year,” he told Bernama, adding that demand remains robust in the China market.

He explained that Malaysia’s Musang King continues to command strong interest, especially among premium fruit consumers in China.

“Right now, it’s impossible to get Grade A Musang King below RM30 per kilogramme (kg) at farm price. During the off-season like May, prices can go up to RM80 per kg. For D24, the lowest is about RM15 per kg,” he said.

According to China’s Ministry of Agriculture, the country imported 19.25 million kg of durians from Malaysia worth US$212.05 million (RM1 billion) between January and December 2024.

Fifteen years ago, Loh said, the farm price for frozen Musang King was about RM25 per kg and could drop as low as RM12 per kg during peak season.

“While for frozen D24, the highest could be RM15 per kg, the lowest can come to RM3 per kg,” he said.

He also said Malaysia started to export durians to China in 2010.

“We are not competing with Thai durians because the prices and quality are completely separate matters. We are actually competing with kiwis and cherries as well as those products from Japan such as strawberries and grapes,” he pointed out.

Loh, who had pioneered Malaysia’s frozen durian exports to China following Beijing’s approval in 2011, said industry players must protect the integrity of the Malaysian durian brands in China.

“Some traders mislabel kampung durians and sell them as Musang King to get higher profits. This is damaging. Even kampung durians have a market if sold honestly.

“We have to educate Chinese consumers on the real characteristics of Musang King, D24 and others,” he emphasised.

He also said the Chinese government has been very supportive and has shown leniency on Malaysian durian exports due to strong diplomatic ties.

Hence, he said, the businesses must maintain the reputation and bilateral relations.

Commenting on attempts to cultivate Musang King in China’s Hainan island, Loh said the results have not matched the standards of Malaysian-grown durians.

“There was initial excitement, but it faded quickly. The taste is different due to the soil and climate. My friend also tried growing it here, but it wasn’t successful. Hainan Musang King cannot replace the Malaysian original,” he added.",1.74628E+12,en,-0.183202148,2025-05-02 13:49:27,"['robust', 'per', 'malaysiangrown', 'following', 'musang', 'supply', 'brand', 'outpace', 'china', 'completely', 'original', 'particularly', 'tried', 'import', 'friend', 'commerce', 'pointed', 'mislabel', 'quickly', 'leniency', 'real', 'export', 'kampung', 'market', 'season', 'approval', 'ago', 'sell', 'offseason', 'strong', 'agriculture', 'keng', 'separate', 'expected', 'lowest', 'integrity', 'matter', 'competing', 'honestly', 'maycham', 'durian', 'last', 'prematurely', 'fifteen', 'january', 'highest', 'others', 'year', 'farm', 'worth', 'grape', 'must', 'driven', 'supportive', 'may', 'beijing', 'drop', 'added', 'malaysian', 'could', 'come', 'trader', 'command', 'increase', 'protect', 'also', 'caused', 'cultivate', 'wee', 'thai', 'loh', 'continues', 'emphasised', 'remains', 'different', 'fruit', 'hence', 'especially', 'hainan', 'king', 'although', 'business', 'chinese', 'cherry', 'ministry', 'explained', 'player', 'chairman', 'challenge', 'sold', 'volume', 'actually', 'well', 'maintain', 'grade', 'december', 'characteristic', 'premium', 'tie', 'pioneered', 'profit', 'standard', 'diplomatic', 'product', 'among', 'get', 'excitement', 'japan', 'demand', 'sustained', 'million', 'result', 'bernama', 'overall', 'adding', 'higher', 'price', 'commenting', 'country', 'successful', 'peak', 'heavy', 'foresee', 'reputation', 'despite', 'damaging', 'matched', 'climate', 'kilogramme', 'weatherrelated', 'interest', 'low', 'imported', 'rain', 'island', 'taste', 'right', 'attempt', 'started', 'soil', 'according', 'recent', 'compared', 'impossible', 'initial', 'government', 'relation', 'growing', 'variety', 'wasnt', 'educate', 'chamber', 'due', 'shown', 'industry', 'malaysia', 'said', 'bilateral', 'even', 'billion', 'faded', 'quality', 'replace', 'told', 'consumer', 'frozen', 'strawberry', 'like', 'kiwi']",Neutral

Fahmi said its minister Datuk Seri Tengku Zafrul Abdul Aziz had briefed the Cabinet about the meeting today, saying the negotiations were centred around certain sectors — but more bilateral talks are needed.

“Tengku Zafrul said the meeting yielded a positive outcome,” Fahmi said at today’s post-Cabinet meeting press conference here.

“He tabled a report on what to do next and several sectors will be the focus of more negotiations.”

Yesterday, Miti announced that it has appointed its deputy secretary-general (trade) Mastura Ahmad Mustafa, one of its most experienced senior civil servants, as Malaysia’s chief negotiator for the upcoming formal tariff negotiations with the United States (US).

Tengku Zafrul said the US has also named one of its assistant United States trade representatives (USTR) to lead the talks, with both sides agreeing to begin discussions after Malaysia’s Cabinet gives the green light.

Tengku Zafrul said among the key focus areas are reducing tariffs, addressing non-tariff barriers — particularly in agriculture — and Malaysia’s trade surplus with the US, which currently stands at US$25 billion (RM108 billion).

Early this month, the US announced higher tariffs on imports from about 60 countries, including on most Malaysian goods at a rate of 24 per cent.

Subsequently, it granted a 90-day pause on the “reciprocal” tariffs for most countries to allow for trade negotiations.

On April 24, Tengku Zafrul led a delegation to meet with the US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in Washington to discuss the tariffs.

The outcome of the first round of US-Malaysia trade talks is expected to be further deliberated at the National Geoeconomic Command Centre (NGCC) meeting today, chaired by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.

TAWAU:

The stability and high price of dry cocoa in the current market are seen as a strong motivator for industry players to re-enter large-scale cocoa cultivation.

Malaysian Cocoa Board Director-General Datuk Ramle Kasin, said that at present, the price of dry cocoa in the market is more stable, ranging from RM25,000 to RM30,000 per tonne (PT).

“Between 2002 and 2003, the price of dry cocoa ranged from RM7,000 to RM8,000 per tonne, before rising sharply to RM40,000 per tonne in 2024.

“Although we see the price of dry cocoa now at RM25,000 to RM30,000 PT, it is more stable and positive, which is a major attraction for industry players,” he said.

Ramle made these remarks during a press conference held in conjunction with the monthly gathering and Hari Raya Aidilfitri celebration at the Cocoa Research and Development Centre (PPK) Tawau and Madai, here, on Monday.

According to him, the success of the seven PPKs nationwide in producing more than 50 high-quality cocoa clones also attracted former industry players to return to cocoa planting.

“We provide advisory services to smallholders and farmers, especially on the research and development (R&D) of new high-quality and high-yielding cocoa clones.

“The demand for these cocoa clones is very good because they can increase production yields, which is a major attraction for industry players to plant cocoa,” he said.

He further explained that currently, there are more than 6,000 hectares of cocoa plantations nationwide, and he is confident that this number will increase with the positive growth trend in the cocoa industry.

He also mentioned that one of the initiatives to boost cocoa production is through the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) or the use of fabricators to monitor soil nutrients.

“The data from the equipment placed in the soil will be transferred to satellites to assess soil suitability and will also allow for early disease control during the rainy season.

“At present, we have a pilot project at several locations, and the results from this initiative have shown that cocoa farmers can increase their yields by up to 30 per cent,” he said.

Ramle also expressed his interest in Tawau’s potential to re-emerge as a major cocoa producer, as it was once the world’s top cocoa producer in the 1970s and 1980s.

He described cocoa growers in Tawau as knowledgeable and experienced, with the land in the area being fertile and suitable for cocoa planting.

“I am confident that if more industry players in this area return to large-scale planting, it can help revive the cocoa industry in Tawau,” he said.

He said that Tawau currently has around 400 smallholders growing cocoa, and this number is expected to continue growing with the positive developments in the industry.

He also advised those interested in planting cocoa to visit the PPK for free advisory services, as well as technical assistance.",1.74612E+12,en,0.773537755,2025-04-30 15:30:51,"['per', 'kasin', 'stability', 'transferred', 'motivator', 'early', 'equipment', 'cocoa', 'planting', 'remark', 'high', 'monday', 'ranged', 'pilot', 'cultivation', 'continue', 'reenter', 'present', 'return', 'yield', 'around', 'market', 'season', 'clone', 'tawaus', 'monthly', 'cent', 'board', 'strong', 'satellite', 'producing', 'use', 'celebration', 'grower', 'expected', 'conference', 'confident', 'fertile', 'tonne', 'dry', 'renewed', 'largescale', 'rainy', 'plant', 'tawau', 'nationwide', 'world', 'boost', 'directorgeneral', 'highquality', 'hope', 'smallholder', 'current', 'held', 'placed', 'malaysian', 'reemerge', 'number', 'advertisement', 'increase', 'also', 'area', 'good', 'production', 'location', 'trend', 'stable', 'suitability', 'especially', 'plantation', 'although', 'nutrient', 'one', 'major', 'potential', 'explained', 'player', 'rising', 'hari', 'control', 'datuk', 'positive', 'free', 'madai', 'well', 'ppk', 'farmer', 'sponsored', 'advised', 'centre', 'described', 'assistance', 'provide', 'see', 'internet', 'visit', 'ranging', 'suitable', 'development', 'demand', 'fabricator', 'result', 'service', 'sharply', 'price', 'attracted', 'raya', 'technical', 'research', 'attraction', 'thing', 'success', 'gathering', 'disease', 'made', 'help', 'growth', 'interest', 'former', 'soil', 'knowledgeable', 'according', 'allow', 'monitor', 'aidilfitri', 'experienced', 'content', 'conjunction', 'growing', 'hectare', 'revive', 'top', 'mentioned', 'initiative', 'assess', 'advisory', 'seven', 'iot', 'data', 'highyielding', 'shown', 'interested', 'industry', 'several', 'producer', 'land', 'ramle', 'said', 'project', 'expressed', 'currently', 'seen', 'new', 'press']",Positive

Malaysia has not made any decision on a proposed regionalization arrangement that could allow for a partial resumption of poultry trade with the United States, a newly released report reveals.

The country imposed a ban on all live poultry and poultry products from the US in June 2022 due to concerns over highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), according to the 2025 National Trade Estimate Report released by the US Trade Representative on March 31.

Regionalization arrangement

To address this, the US Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (Aphis) proposed a regionalization arrangement in December 2022. Under this proposal, only areas affected by HPAI would face trade suspensions, allowing poultry exports to continue from unaffected regions. However, Malaysia has yet to complete internal discussions on the matter.

“Aphis subsequently provided additional information about its HPAI control programs at the request of the Malaysian veterinary services department,” the report noted. “But to date, Malaysia has not completed internal decision-making to begin discussion on a regionalization arrangement.”

Latest tariff impacts

The uncertainty over regionalization comes at a time when the latest tariffs announced by President Trump could further complicate poultry trade between the two countries. The proposed tariffs, which target Malaysian exports, may trigger retaliatory measures or influence Malaysia’s approach to future trade agreements, including poultry imports.

Industry observers suggest that if tariffs lead to strained trade relations, it could delay or even derail discussions on lifting the poultry ban, affecting US exporters seeking to regain access to the Malaysian market.

While the US continues to push for regionalisation to reopen trade channels, Malaysia’s stance remains unclear amid shifting trade policies and concerns over domestic poultry supply stability.",1.7461E+12,en,-0.458418131,2025-04-30 23:01:55,"['lead', 'time', 'stability', 'derail', 'supply', 'suggest', 'highly', 'including', 'policy', 'inspection', 'exporter', 'allowing', 'import', 'provided', 'program', 'export', 'continue', 'newly', 'yet', 'market', 'trade', 'retaliatory', 'agriculture', 'uncertainty', 'decision', 'reopen', 'matter', 'face', 'june', 'representative', 'regain', 'completed', 'complicate', 'domestic', 'proposed', 'plant', 'request', 'regionalization', 'estimate', 'live', 'influenza', 'may', 'complete', 'malaysian', 'proposal', 'could', 'come', 'trump', 'internal', 'channel', 'additional', 'area', 'address', 'continues', 'aphis', 'remains', 'shifting', 'push', 'stance', 'unaffected', 'seeking', 'united', 'state', 'latest', 'target', 'control', 'impact', 'announced', 'animal', 'two', 'discussion', 'avian', 'lifting', 'december', 'pathogenic', 'malay', 'date', 'observer', 'however', 'future', 'agreement', 'product', 'veterinary', 'tariff', 'begin', 'noted', 'released', 'region', 'health', 'measure', 'information', 'service', 'affecting', 'decisionmaking', 'poultry', 'country', 'amid', 'access', 'subsequently', 'influence', 'regionalisation', 'melayu', 'report', 'hpai', 'national', 'approach', 'made', 'would', 'trigger', 'according', 'allow', 'concern', 'imposed', 'unclear', 'relation', 'partial', 'content', 'reveals', 'strained', 'delay', 'affected', 'available', 'due', 'ban', 'industry', 'department', 'malaysia', 'arrangement', 'president', 'even', 'resumption', 'suspension', 'march']",Neutral

Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad described the situation as ""deeply worrying"", noting that many of these products are widely available both online and in physical shops with little to no oversight.

“A total of 21,571 units of unauthorised products were seized last year, valued at RM37.5 million. This marks an increase from 20,157 units worth RM24.8 million seized in 2023,” he said.

“Out of that number, 17,630 were unregistered supplements, while 3,941 were cosmetic products,” he told reporters after launching the Central Zone leg of the 2025 TOBaTS (Kembara Ubat Tidak Sah) awareness campaign at Dewan Dato’ Penggawa Permatang in Shar Alam on Saturday.

Dzulkefly warned that Malaysia is facing a serious health threat, as such products can cause long-term damage to major organs including the liver, kidneys and nervous system, and even lead to organ failure.

“Many people are deceived into buying these products, which are sold openly and often display fake holograms to appear legitimate,” he explained. “For example, one brand of medicated oil was found to be unregistered after being checked via the PharmaChecker mobile app.”

The minister highlighted five categories of illegal medicines currently circulating: counterfeit drugs, unregistered medicines, those containing scheduled poisons, illegally imported products, and items manufactured without compliance to regulatory standards.

He said the ministry is intensifying its crackdown on such products through a dual strategy of public education and regulatory enforcement.

The TOBaTS roadshow, currently in Selangor, will be expanded nationwide as part of this initiative.

“The government is also incurring huge costs every year to treat complications caused by these illegal medicines. For instance, treating a single chronic kidney disease (CKD) patient can exceed RM5,000 annually. It's far better to prevent than to cure,” he said.

Dzulkefly urged the public and the media to actively spread awareness and report suspicious products. He also encouraged the use of tools like the PharmaChecker app to verify the legitimacy of medicines.

“This is not the Health Ministry’s responsibility alone. Safeguarding public health is a shared duty because the health of our people is a national asset,” he added. - May 3, 2025",1.7463E+12,en,-0.611441374,2025-05-03 07:42:00,"['lead', 'minister', 'huge', 'online', 'app', 'annually', 'brand', 'across', 'unregistered', 'serious', 'found', 'substance', 'valued', 'including', 'fake', 'tobats', 'central', 'appear', 'saturday', 'treat', 'cure', 'tool', 'chronic', 'seri', 'single', 'dual', 'use', 'damage', 'circulating', 'far', 'facing', 'last', 'organ', 'shar', 'nervous', 'spread', 'nationwide', 'year', 'shared', 'often', 'oil', 'worth', 'mobile', 'legitimate', 'medicine', 'hologram', 'added', 'moh', 'deceived', 'may', 'sah', 'responsibility', 'liver', 'number', 'increase', 'expanded', 'also', 'caused', 'patient', 'leg', 'dewan', 'duty', 'roadshow', 'ckd', 'manufactured', 'containing', 'buying', 'uncovered', 'highlighted', 'one', 'alone', 'major', 'asset', 'medium', 'ministry', 'explained', 'prevent', 'supplement', 'worrying', 'enforcement', 'treating', 'datuk', 'unauthorised', 'threat', 'encouraged', 'permatang', 'category', 'checked', 'selangor', 'sold', 'tidak', 'illegally', 'without', 'described', 'mark', 'warned', 'complication', 'situation', 'standard', 'widely', 'product', 'ubat', 'item', 'deeply', 'unit', 'ahmad', 'penggawa', 'reporter', 'incurring', 'circulation', 'campaign', 'dato', 'education', 'illegal', 'kidney', 'actively', 'cost', 'million', 'little', 'crackdown', 'physical', 'health', 'openly', 'harmful', 'country', 'cosmetic', 'example', 'regulatory', 'suspicious', 'pharmachecker', 'instance', 'dzulkefly', 'every', 'people', 'alam', 'legitimacy', 'strategy', 'report', 'potentially', 'drug', 'disease', 'via', 'national', 'five', 'longterm', 'imported', 'total', 'counterfeit', 'noting', 'display', 'poison', 'awareness', 'system', 'failure', 'public', 'part', 'cause', 'compliance', 'scheduled', 'government', 'medicated', 'verify', 'launching', 'shop', 'seized', 'initiative', 'available', 'exceed', 'malaysia', 'said', 'many', 'intensifying', 'kembara', 'currently', 'even', 'urged', 'told', 'oversight', 'safeguarding', 'better', 'zone', 'like']",Negative

PUTRAJAYA, May 2 (Bernama) -- Kosovo is set to deepen diplomatic, economic and security ties with Malaysia, signified by the opening of its embassy in Kuala Lumpur on Friday. Kosovo President Dr Vjosa Osmani Sadriu, who is on a four-day official visit to Malaysia beginning Thursday, announced the opening of the embassy during a joint press conference with Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim on Friday following their high-level talks. “It marks a new chapter in bilateral relations built on mutual trust, solidarity and shared values,” she said, as Anwar welcomed the embassy’s establishment, describing it as a significant milestone that would further facilitate cooperation in trade, investment, education, culture and tourism.

Expressing deep gratitude for Malaysia's longstanding support, Osmani said the bond between the two nations was built not only through diplomacy but also on shared values of unity, dignity and diversity. Reaffirming the strength of bilateral relations, she described Malaysia as ""more than just a friend to Kosovo,"" but a “partner in our shared pursuit of peace, prosperity and progress.” She recalled Malaysia's unwavering support during Kosovo's most difficult moments in 1999, and its early recognition of Kosovo's independence in 2008, describing these gestures as acts that carried hope and belief in the future of her country.

""The people of Kosovo will never forget that you were with us during the most difficult times in our history... and for that, our gratitude will never fade,"" she said. According to Osmani, both leaders explored new avenues to strengthen bilateral relations, including enhancing diplomatic ties, boosting economic cooperation and fostering greater engagement across multiple sectors such as agriculture, energy, technology, and the halal industry. She also expressed appreciation for Malaysia's decision to lift visa requirements for Kosovo citizens, describing it as an act of trust and friendship that would further enhance people-to-people connections.",1.74628E+12,en,0.828277886,2025-05-02 07:56:14,"['minister', 'time', 'following', 'thursday', 'sector', 'across', 'early', 'pursuit', 'bond', 'kosovo', 'including', 'ibrahim', 'cooperation', 'friend', 'diversity', 'citizen', 'prosperity', 'peopletopeople', 'welcomed', 'trade', 'security', 'seri', 'mutual', 'unity', 'unwavering', 'trust', 'facilitate', 'agriculture', 'decision', 'conference', 'recognition', 'energy', 'putrajaya', 'friday', 'enhance', 'act', 'signified', 'lumpur', 'investment', 'embassy', 'shared', 'moment', 'value', 'leader', 'halal', 'peace', 'may', 'difficult', 'hope', 'belief', 'progress', 'avenue', 'economic', 'also', 'enhancing', 'official', 'highlevel', 'greater', 'longstanding', 'deepen', 'forget', 'recalled', 'talk', 'diplomacy', 'significant', 'datuk', 'set', 'announced', 'strength', 'independence', 'boosting', 'appreciation', 'vjosa', 'technology', 'two', 'osmani', 'mark', 'expressing', 'described', 'never', 'tie', 'requirement', 'sadriu', 'chapter', 'deep', 'joint', 'visit', 'future', 'diplomatic', 'friendship', 'support', 'nation', 'milestone', 'education', 'lift', 'engagement', 'fostering', 'bernama', 'visa', 'country', 'strengthen', 'explored', 'gratitude', 'solidarity', 'people', 'multiple', 'tourism', 'fourday', 'would', 'culture', 'built', 'carried', 'according', 'gesture', 'connection', 'partner', 'kuala', 'relation', 'describing', 'fade', 'anwar', 'reaffirming', 'establishment', 'history', 'industry', 'malaysia', 'president', 'bilateral', 'said', 'opening', 'beginning', 'dignity', 'expressed', 'prime', 'new', 'press']",Positive

KIULU:

Building on the success of community tourism, Kiulu is now exploring community farming as a new initiative to further empower rural residents.

Kiulu assemblyman Datuk Joniston Bangkuai said the concept would mirror the community tourism model that has positioned Kiulu as an example for others to follow.

“The model of community involvement and shared responsibility has worked well for us in tourism, and now we want to apply the same principles to agriculture.

“This community farming effort will be developed on gazetted village reserve lands, which will provide structured spaces for agricultural activities,” he said

Currently, Joniston said almost 30 villages in Kiulu already have such gazetted lands, making them ideal for the initiative.

The Assistant Tourism, Culture, and Environment Minister added local leaders, including village heads and JKKK chairpersons with farming experience, should lead the implementation to ensure community ownership.

“The Kiulu Adun Service Centre will coordinate with the Tuaran District Agriculture Department and grassroots leaders to facilitate engagement and technical input to ensure successful implementation.

“This libat urus will serve as a foundation for preparing a comprehensive concept paper to be submitted to the relevant ministry for funding support,” he explained.

The community farming initiative aligns with the Sabah Maju Jaya agenda focused on rural development and economic sustainability.

Kiulu is already known for its cultivation of pineapple, ginger, and hill paddy, all of which have market potential if developed further.

“These are our signature crops. We want to maximise their value and make Kiulu a centre for premium produce,” said Joniston, noting the future goal of setting up processing factories to add value and create jobs locally.

Since starting with just a handful of tourism operators in 2014, Kiulu has grown to host over 80 operators today, creating part-time and full-time employment for more than 400 locals

ARAU, May 3 (Bernama) -- The use of types of road barriers in this country is based on suitability according to technical justification in a specific area to determine the materials that can be used to ensure the safety of road users. Works Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi said that his ministry is always attentive to the latest materials and technological developments from time to time, with a unit that tests the material samples to determine whether they are suitable for use on the country's roads or not. ""When a new material is introduced in our market, we take a sample to see if it is suitable for our country, because our country has different elements (for example) excessive rain. So what is good in other countries may not necessarily be also good in ours,"" he said.

He made these remarks to reporters after inspecting the major project currently being developed at Universiti Malaysia Perlis (UniMAP) here today. Also present was UniMAP vice-chancellor Prof Datuk Dr Zaliman Sauli. Nanta said this when asked to comment on whether the Works Ministry (KKR) has plans to replace concrete or metal road barriers with shock-absorbing materials to prevent fatal accidents. Nanta said, for example, on the Karak Highway in hilly areas, a 'roller barrier' type road barrier is used, which is a composite component that is not rigid, but it cannot be used in all areas as some areas have to use concrete barriers.

Nanta said, for example, on the Karak highway in hilly areas, a 'roller barrier' type of road barrier is used, which is a composite component that is not hard, but it cannot be used in all areas as some areas need concrete barriers.

Department of Fisheries’ (DOF) Director-General, Datuk Adnan Hussain, said that this amount was solely from Sarawak, out of the national total of 510,000 metric tonnes of aquaculture production recorded last year.

“Based on that data, around 11,000 metric tonnes came from Sarawak, which means Sarawak is one of the key aquaculture producers in the country.

“This especially can be seen in the agri-food segment. In Sarawak, this sub-sector or agri-food field is indeed a necessity,” he said.

He stated this during the ‘Rasa-Rasa Akuakultur’ Programme and the MyAgropreneur Fisheries (myAP), MyFisheries Community (myKP) Carnival organised by the Sarawak Marine Fisheries Department at the Majma Mall today.

He further emphasised that efforts to increase aquaculture production must be strengthened.

Adnan revealed that, according to the targets set under the National Agrofood Policy, the goal by 2030 is to reach approximately 950,000 metric tonnes.

“Our journey is still far, but we have great potential, and I believe with the commitment of all parties, we can achieve our aspirations,” he said.

Commenting on the programme, Adnan believes that its organisation can help boost aquaculture activities, and promote aquaculture products in Sarawak.

He revealed that several local products from Sarawak have the potential to be highlighted on a larger scale.

“Looking at some of the products here (in Sarawak), they can be brought to major exhibitions like MAHA (Malaysia Agriculture, Horticulture and Agrotourism International Show) to showcase Sarawak’s products,” he said.",1.74636E+12,en,0.557606638,2025-05-03 09:18:42,"['strengthened', 'agrofood', 'scale', 'brought', 'fishery', 'myagropreneur', 'mykp', 'organisation', 'larger', 'policy', 'amount', 'akuakultur', 'marine', 'around', 'agrotourism', 'rasarasa', 'agriculture', 'largest', 'showcase', 'solely', 'far', 'tonne', 'boat', 'look', 'last', 'director', 'year', 'aspiration', 'boost', 'directorgeneral', 'programme', 'must', 'taking', 'senior', 'international', 'belief', 'increase', 'segment', 'show', 'also', 'based', 'key', 'production', 'emphasised', 'mean', 'especially', 'highlighted', 'one', 'potential', 'today', 'major', 'agrifood', 'commitment', 'model', 'target', 'datuk', 'sarawak', 'revealed', 'set', 'party', 'output', 'believe', 'carnival', 'aquaculture', 'majma', 'abdul', 'journey', 'kuching', 'organised', 'metric', 'product', 'maha', 'among', 'looking', 'observing', 'achieve', 'effort', 'reef', 'recording', 'wahab', 'commenting', 'necessity', 'country', 'promote', 'myfisheries', 'hussain', 'activity', 'myap', 'indeed', 'horticulture', 'mall', 'subsector', 'approximately', 'national', 'field', 'stated', 'help', 'accompanied', 'community', 'total', 'according', 'rahman', 'second', 'great', 'recorded', 'dof', 'fishing', 'artificial', 'came', 'goal', 'local', 'adnan', 'reach', 'data', 'still', 'department', 'producer', 'several', 'said', 'malaysia', 'contributor', 'exhibition', 'general', 'seen', 'left', 'displayed', 'like']",Positive

He said that although the subsidy has been reduced, egg prices are still subject to price control, and the ministry will not compromise with any party that tries to raise prices arbitrarily.

“I am not merely expressing hope, but stressing and reminding all parties that they are still bound by the controlled price of eggs in the market, do not raise the price at will. Our officers are monitoring the situation together with the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (KPKM),” he told a press conference after launching the RON97 products here on Saturday.

Also present was Petronas Dagangan Bhd (KL:PETDAG) chief operating officer Azureen Azita Abdullah.

The government had previously announced the removal of chicken egg price controls, with subsidies reduced from 10 sen to five sen per egg effective Thursday before complete termination on Aug 1.

Armizan said the decision to reduce the subsidy was made after lengthy discussions and took into account the risk of rising egg prices as well as the need to ensure continued availability of eggs in the market.

He said KPDN is also carrying out various operations to monitor the prices and supply of goods including eggs, and that the government has set up a special committee to coordinate action to ensure price stability and market availability.

He added that the public is encouraged to use the various KPDN complaint platforms to report any issues concerning the price or supply of eggs or other essential goods in the market, and that the ministry will investigate complaints within 24 hours.

“KPDN is committed to tracing each price-related complaint within 24 hours, so submit your report on the platform and we will take immediate action if any party raises egg prices,” he said.

SABAK BERNAM : The unplanned construction of houses and village developments is among the critical challenges faced by the Selangor government in tackling flood problems, according to executive councillor Izham Hashim.

He said recent data indicated several villages urgently need flood mitigation measures. “The state government will take a more aggressive approach. We will proceed with building major drains or water gates if there are no other options,” he said.

“We cannot hesitate in making decisions that help people deal with this problem. We cannot wait any longer because the people are suffering severe consequences, made worse by increasingly unpredictable weather patterns,” he told reporters here today.

Izham said he would also visit several flood-prone hotspots in Klang on Monday to get a clearer picture of the flood mitigation plans. The visit would involve various related agencies, including the public works department, drainage and irrigation department, and the local authorities.

“While major projects are being completed, I’ll go to the ground and check each site before coordinating and implementing early action,” he added.

Penang Water Supply Corporation (PBAPP) chief executive officer, Datuk K. Pathmanathan, said that while the target may appear modest, it could yield significant long-term benefits in terms of water supply sufficiency and security.

“If all 1.8 million Penang residents reduce their household water use by 11 LPCD, the cumulative savings could reach 19.8 million litres per day (MLD) this year,” he said during the World Water Day celebration at the Air Itam Dam today.

The event was officiated by Penang Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow and attended by Water Watch Penang president, Prof Emeritus Datuk Dr Chan Ngai Weng.

Pathmanathan added that the projected domestic savings are expected to contribute to an estimated 2.3 percent reduction in Penang’s overall water consumption, from 870 MLD last year to approximately 850 MLD this year.

Saying domestic water use accounted for approximately 54 percent of total water consumption last year, he encouraged Penangites to use water more efficiently to help stabilise supply and reduce service disruptions in end-of-line distribution areas and highland zones in Seberang Perai Selatan and the Barat Daya District.

Meanwhile, Pathmanathan noted that climate change has also impacted operations, with the effective capacities of the Teluk Bahang and Air Itam dams decreasing by 13.1 percent and 22.6 percent, respectively, due to low rainfall since January.

He explained that although both dams are designed to be replenished by rainwater within their catchment areas, the significant reduction in rainfall, coupled with prolonged El Niño conditions, has hampered their recovery in recent years.

Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra inspects the progress made in the construction of a road linking a new Sadao border checkpoint in Songkhla with Bukit Kayu Hitam ICQS checkpoint in Malaysia in February. GOVERNMENT HOUSE

The government is forging closer cooperation with Malaysia on infrastructure improvement and cross-border connectivity, focusing on linking roads and rails, says Transport Minister Suriya Juengrunreangkit.

He welcomed his Malaysian counterpart, Anthony Loke, in Bangkok on Friday and both ministers exchanged views on how to enhance transport networks between both countries for speedier and safer travel and freight.

Afterwards, Mr Suriya said key outcomes of the meeting included an agreement to expedite two memorandums of understanding concerning cross-border transport: one for goods and another for passengers.

The main goal is to sign both MoUs by July to support economic activities, resolve freight transport issues and ease travel for citizens.

The ministers also endorsed linking digital driving licence databases with international driving permits through Asean mechanisms.

Regarding rail transport, Mr Suriya said he and Mr Anthony discussed the revival of the train line between Sungai Kolok station in Thailand's Narathiwat province and Rantau Panjang in Malaysia.

The State Railway of Thailand and Keretapi Tanah Melayu would make use of the KTMB-SRT Joint Conference to determine a timeline for resuming services.

Mr Suriya said this move aligns with Malaysia's East Coast Rail Link project, slated for the fourth quarter of 2026, and aims to restore historical cross-border transport links.

Thailand and Malaysia are also set to revive a train line between Bangkok and Butterworth in the Malaysian state of Penang in July, he said. The SRT discontinued its express train service from Bangkok to Butterworth in 2016, with the route now ending at Padang Besar station in Songkla's Sadao district, a border train station shared by the two countries.

""The revived operation will be a key milestone in the progress to connect the two countries,"" said Mr Suriya.

Furthermore, both sides discussed easing international rail freight transport, particularly pushing for a Single Window Inspection system at the point of entry to reduce cargo inspection times.

Mr Anthony's visit to Thailand, which was arranged not long after Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra visited Malaysia last month, is set to display both countries' ambitions to develop their diplomatic relationship and related bilateral cooperation.

""The discussion is one of the main opportunities for both countries to exchange suggestions while planning for more cooperation in the future,"" said Mr Suriya.",1.74638E+12,en,0.404068708,2025-05-03 23:06:00,"['minister', 'restore', 'licence', 'time', 'meeting', 'asean', 'counterpart', 'bukit', 'entry', 'side', 'database', 'road', 'exchanged', 'express', 'province', 'particularly', 'inspection', 'driving', 'rantau', 'cooperation', 'ease', 'say', 'window', 'afterwards', 'citizen', 'welcomed', 'develop', 'checkpoint', 'move', 'station', 'single', 'train', 'use', 'conference', 'another', 'freight', 'friday', 'enhance', 'tanah', 'crossborder', 'mechanism', 'besar', 'travel', 'connect', 'sungai', 'month', 'last', 'kolok', 'listen', 'shared', 'infrastructure', 'boost', 'included', 'pushing', 'network', 'icqs', 'revival', 'article', 'malaysian', 'construction', 'international', 'progress', 'aligns', 'thailand', 'opportunity', 'future', 'economic', 'also', 'exchange', 'improvement', 'passenger', 'ktmbsrt', 'good', 'key', 'regarding', 'push', 'safer', 'one', 'resolve', 'speedier', 'concerning', 'july', 'inspects', 'state', 'border', 'suriya', 'long', 'related', 'set', 'songkhla', 'view', 'mous', 'issue', 'make', 'two', 'discussion', 'linking', 'determine', 'anthony', 'visited', 'memorandum', 'railway', 'tie', 'furthermore', 'agreement', 'joint', 'district', 'shinawatra', 'visit', 'diplomatic', 'penang', 'point', 'sign', 'relationship', 'discontinued', 'permit', 'historical', 'songklas', 'support', 'milestone', 'house', 'ambition', 'planning', 'hitam', 'timeline', 'narathiwat', 'panjang', 'service', 'padang', 'bangkok', 'country', 'coast', 'ending', 'easing', 'route', 'keretapi', 'activity', 'digital', 'kayu', 'closer', 'understanding', 'expedite', 'melayu', 'revived', 'fourth', 'made', 'help', 'main', 'would', 'srt', 'discussed', 'forging', 'east', 'display', 'aim', 'system', 'government', 'february', 'juengrunreangkit', 'connectivity', 'link', 'reduce', 'operation', 'sadao', 'goal', 'slated', 'outcome', 'revive', 'line', 'paetongtarn', 'focusing', 'cargo', 'malaysia', 'endorsed', 'said', 'bilateral', 'project', 'loke', 'prime', 'rail', 'suggestion', 'new', 'resuming', 'butterworth', 'quarter', 'arranged', 'transport']",Neutral

The export of excess stocks will help ensure better prices for fresh coconuts while local supply will not be affected, said Joez Coconut director Joel Jeyachandran.

These coconuts, of the Matag variety, are not only consumed as coconut water but are also popular as coconut shakes and jelly.

He said Matag coconuts, which are green and known for their sweet, juicy water, are ideal for exports.

On April 16, Malaysia received approval to export fresh coconuts to China following the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the two countries.

He said an oversupply in the market could cause the wholesale price of RM4 per coconut to drop sharply, resulting in losses to suppliers.

“Exporting the surplus will not negatively impact domestic availability. In fact, during rainy weather, local consumption of fresh coconuts declines, increasing the surplus.

“Prices often fall at such times and exporting the surplus will be good,” said Joel, who gets his coconuts from farms in Bagan Datok and Pantai Remis in Perak.

Joel, who supplies between 80,000 and 100,000 fresh coconuts to local retailers each month, noted that not all coconuts are suitable for export or prolonged storage.

Certain varieties, like the Pandan coconut, must be kept fresh.

“Pandan coconuts are prized for their fragrance and must be consumed within 18 to 20 days of harvest. Otherwise, they lose their aroma and market value,” he said.

“As for the Mawar variety, its flesh is thick and creamy. It is used for making coconut milk,” Joel added.

SL Coconut Trading director A. Loganathan, who owns four plantations spanning about 400ha in Manjung and Bagan Datok, said he turned down an export deal due to the high risks associated with delivering fresh coconuts to China.

“I was told the shipment would take around 10 days to arrive. Fresh coconuts typically last only about a week without refrigeration, and exposure to heat during transit could cause them to crack and spoil before they reach their destination,” he said.

“Moreover, the prices offered were too low.”

Still, Loganathan is optimistic about receiving more attractive offers to launch his export venture.

“Malaysia has high-quality coconuts and many people in other countries are incorporating them into their culinary practices.

“I hope to tap into this growing market,” he said.

Previously, Malaysia had been exporting young coconuts to China based solely on general phytosanitary certificates, without any specific protocol in place.

The signing of the MOU, however, will see greater emphasis on the requirements for registered farms and adherence to good agricultural practices.

PETALING JAYA : Fear comes with the rain whenever there is a downpour at Taman Mas, Puchong, especially for residents of the 29-storey Koi Prima condominium building.

There is the fear of the impact that repeated water damage since the Selangor floods of 2021 has made on the building’s foundation. “Whenever it rains, we live in fear,” says Yogendran Krishnan, former secretary of the Koi Prima Residents Association.

The residents’ problems are not over after the floodwaters recede, because of damage to the lifts, said Yogendran.

“Even if the water level rises less than a foot, the lifts get damaged. Imagine the inconvenience if the lifts are out for two days or more,” he said.

Another resident, Gugan Ravi, told FMT they would sound the fire alarm whenever the water level starts to rise, “so that residents who have parked their vehicles on the ground floor or at street level can repark them on higher ground”.

A response team would also spring into action whenever there is a flood, waking up residents during the night to warn them of rising waters.

Gugan said that after the last major floods in 2022, the residents initially had to fork out a total of RM3 million to repair the communal property that had been damaged, although they were later compensated by the building’s insurers.

Rainy days are particularly challenging for rubber tappers as they cannot work and thus lose their primary income source.

""My family relies on the income from rubber tapping to buy daily necessities and pay for the schooling of three of my six children.

In such circumstances, Siti Zaleha said the government aid through Sumbangan Tunai Rahmah (STR) and Sumbangan Asas Rahmah (SARA) provides hope, helping her family cover daily expenses.

She said the STR and SARA assistance has been crucial in helping the family meet household needs, school expenses, and care for her ailing husband.

The initiative aims to provide the public with more affordable options and help stabilise egg prices.

“We also want to boost the supply of special grade eggs that are cheaper, like during the recent Ramadan period when they were sold at RM5 per tray,” Mohamad told reporters after attending a Pakatan Harapan Terengganu Hari Raya Open House.

“This time, we don’t know the exact price yet, but we are confident it won’t skyrocket,” Bernama cited him saying.

On 30 April, the ministry announced the termination of egg subsidies, but stated that a series of intervention measures would be implemented in collaboration with the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Cost of Living to mitigate the impact on the public.

Among the measures, the government assured that industry players had agreed to introduce special grade eggs at a reasonable price.

Mohamad also highlighted that Malaysians could continue to access competitively priced eggs through the nationwide Jualan Agro MADANI and Jualan Rahmah initiatives.

He explained that the decision to completely remove subsidies and price controls on eggs—alongside reducing the subsidy rate from RM0.10 to RM0.05 per egg effective from 1 May—was made after thorough consultation with stakeholders.

“We first negotiated with egg producers and industry players. We also adopted a soft landing approach, rather than making a sudden withdrawal. So I am confident egg prices will not surge uncontrollably,” he said.

Mohamad further called for an increase in the cultivation of local young coconuts, particularly fragrant varieties such as pandan coconuts, in response to growing demand from China.

“This is an opportunity for Terengganu, for instance, with its vast land to focus on this crop that can yield good income.

“… China has a population of over 1.4 billion, with more than 800 million able to spend… this is a wide-open economic opportunity,” he said.

On 19 April, Director-General of Agriculture Datuk Nor Sam Alwi announced that the opening of the fresh coconut market to China under the Phytosanitary Requirements Protocol marks a step forward in biosecurity controls and enhances systematic traceability in the production of high-quality young coconuts.

He said Malaysia would export young coconuts for fresh drinking purposes, with priority given to fragrant varieties such as pandan coconuts. - May 4, 2025",1.74645E+12,en,0.429020315,2025-05-04 10:57:00,"['per', 'minister', 'time', 'following', 'pakatan', 'supply', 'pandan', 'completely', 'china', 'period', 'particularly', 'cultivation', 'harapan', 'export', 'continue', 'priced', 'yield', 'yet', 'market', 'trade', 'security', 'seri', 'jualan', 'step', 'ramadan', 'dont', 'lowerpriced', 'agriculture', 'wideopen', 'skyrocket', 'systematic', 'decision', 'confident', 'collaboration', 'landing', 'mohamad', 'drinking', 'domestic', 'food', 'option', 'series', 'priority', 'nationwide', 'sabu', 'boost', 'directorgeneral', 'protocol', 'highquality', 'may', 'madani', 'biosecurity', 'wont', 'malaysian', 'mitigate', 'eggsalongside', 'agro', 'could', 'vast', 'egg', 'cited', 'increase', 'opportunity', 'living', 'economic', 'also', 'alwi', 'good', 'kpkm', 'consultation', 'surge', 'production', 'exact', 'special', 'reasonable', 'starting', 'phytosanitary', 'end', 'stakeholder', 'highlighted', 'response', 'ministry', 'explained', 'know', 'player', 'hari', 'spend', 'fresh', 'assured', 'datuk', 'control', 'impact', 'called', 'announced', 'traceability', 'uncontrollably', 'sold', 'open', 'sam', 'negotiated', 'grade', 'soft', 'mark', 'provide', 'requirement', 'august', 'rather', 'withdrawal', 'agreed', 'product', 'purpose', 'income', 'chicken', 'among', 'reporter', 'effective', 'house', 'demand', 'cost', 'million', 'measure', 'bernama', 'first', 'price', 'raya', 'access', 'crop', 'introduce', 'fragrant', 'instance', 'given', 'young', 'focus', 'able', 'remove', 'maywas', 'implemented', 'competitively', 'rahmah', 'approach', 'made', 'help', 'stated', 'affordable', 'saying', 'would', 'terengganu', 'according', 'stabilise', 'recent', 'population', 'public', 'aim', 'want', 'government', 'cheaper', 'growing', 'rate', 'variety', 'sudden', 'local', 'forward', 'subsidy', 'initiative', 'intervention', 'adopted', 'termination', 'april', 'industry', 'thorough', 'land', 'producer', 'malaysia', 'said', 'coconut', 'attending', 'opening', 'reducing', 'billion', 'making', 'tray', 'told', 'enhances', 'like']",Neutral
agriculture,A ‘game changer’ for agriculture,1.7464E+12,The Star,www.thestar.com.my,https://news.google.com/read/CBMihwFBVV95cUxPNGh2dG4yWjA2Z24xaGo1aFU0SnhSSDltMFdrY0NzN2E2NVNydFdGSkdVMGR3MHZybHB1STFod3c4TGQ4dUw4SEliWk9BTC01WnhQRlp6Zmt3ak5idG5jZFptVTRrcTdxX2tnWjIxT3B3SGY3Y3VKc1ZiQWpxdnpBZmk5U1BsMjg?hl=en-MY&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen,https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2025/05/05/a-game-changer-for-agriculture,"KAJANG: The marigold plants outside his home are standing tall at over one metre, far surpassing their average height of 60cm.

Civil engineer Tan Hong Boon attributed this to his very own innovation of a low-cost system in which rainwater is stored underground as an oasis or water reservoir for plants to drink from.

“With my system, the plants get constant access to water and are able to naturally optimise their own growth,” he said.

In an interview, Tan said the idea to develop his “WaterSave Planting System” came about after he noticed how water was wasted using traditional watering methods.

“Traditional methods will wet the surface of the soil, which then attracts the roots of the plant to grow somewhat upwards as roots grow towards the source of nutrients or water.

“This results in less optimal growth as the roots will be left in dry, hard soil when the top soil layer dries naturally over the course of the day, affecting their ability to do photosynthesis and grow.”

With his method, Tan said that an even-level hole is dug to cover the area where crops are to be grown on top of it.

Then an impermeable membrane, which can be as simple as a plastic sheet, is placed to cover the entire bottom of the hole and the walls of the hole.

Finally, an even layer of sand is placed throughout the membrane before soil is then added back on and seeds or crops are planted on the soil.

“Rainwater that lands on the soil flows down until it reaches the membrane where it stays as a reservoir for weeks, thanks to the sand being unable to absorb the water.

“The plant’s roots then naturally head downwards until it reaches the sand layer, giving it constant access to a water source whenever it needs.”

“This makes it cheaper and easier to grow plants as you need not install pipes or sprinklers,” said Tan, 62. Neither is there a need to hire extra hands to water the plants everyday.

This proposed method reduces or even cuts out the need for additional watering altogether.

Tan, who is a former president of the Natural Farming Association Malaysia, said the system also makes the plants grow faster and produce better yields than traditional farming methods.

He explained that his idea for the system began in 2019 when he used a terrarium box to grow plants. By 2022, he developed it into the WaterSave Planting System, which he used in his farm in Kajang.

Seeing his plants growing well without being watered gave him the assurance that he was on the right track.

This prompted him to apply for a grant from the All-Party Parliamentary Group Malaysia - Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) last year.

Using this grant, Tan introduced his system to an Orang Asli community in Semenyih where he taught them how to use it to grow long beans to earn a living.

“The depth and size of the hole depends on the plant. Different species need different levels of water, so it required some engineering and agricultural input.

“But once it was set up and I trained the farmers, they could easily maintain their farm.

“They didn’t even need to water the land for months. The long beans not only grew faster but much bigger and of higher quality,” he said.

Tan’s system caught the eye of his fellow engineering graduate Keith Kee from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.

Kee helped Tan to submit an application for an international green technology competition named the Greentech Pitch Day, which is run by the international environmental, social and governance (ESG) consulting firm CorpStage.

On March 29, Tan’s WaterSave Planting System won the competition, edging out thousands of other ESG-related proposals from across the world.

Tan has also implemented his system in other projects such as in building a farm for the Gurdwara Sahib Machap Babe Ke in Johor last month.

And thanks to Kee’s connections, Tan’s system is being explored for use in floral landscaping at properties in Singapore by a real estate company.

“I am also looking at more local community awareness programmes so I can educate home gardeners on how to implement it. I believe this can be a big game changer in the agricultural industry,” Tan added.",1.74645E+12,en,0.003447577,2025-05-04 23:09:03,"['gurdwara', 'surface', 'sahib', 'esgrelated', 'watersave', 'finally', 'average', 'named', 'cut', 'across', 'head', 'planting', 'flow', 'bigger', 'developed', 'watered', 'track', 'underground', 'hard', 'sheet', 'esg', 'wet', 'standing', 'real', 'changer', 'yield', 'lowcost', 'civil', 'installing', 'parliamentary', 'marigold', 'develop', 'corpstage', 'social', 'optimise', 'somewhat', 'taught', 'use', 'orang', 'eye', 'surpassing', 'reallife', 'whenever', 'babe', 'far', 'firm', 'gardener', 'dry', 'oasis', 'worker', 'courtesy', 'trained', 'month', 'proposed', 'last', 'wasted', 'plant', 'source', 'course', 'run', 'depth', 'reservoir', 'throughout', 'farm', 'year', 'grow', 'required', 'world', 'programme', 'metre', 'stored', 'better', 'added', 'height', 'thanks', 'absorb', 'tan', 'grown', 'placed', 'idea', 'proposal', 'plastic', 'began', 'kees', 'could', 'floral', 'international', 'university', 'specie', 'boon', 'living', 'estate', 'introduced', 'also', 'nanyang', 'additional', 'photosynthesis', 'depends', 'consulting', 'edging', 'area', 'layer', 'farming', 'impermeable', 'allparty', 'semenyih', 'terrarium', 'outside', 'application', 'different', 'hand', 'prompted', 'planted', 'extra', 'grew', 'used', 'nutrient', 'one', 'group', 'sand', 'explained', 'attracts', 'association', 'long', 'earn', 'set', 'root', 'unable', 'believe', 'less', 'reduces', 'didnt', 'bean', 'make', 'rainwater', 'upwards', 'technology', 'maintain', 'well', 'assurance', 'attributed', 'farmer', 'thousand', 'asli', 'without', 'green', 'produce', 'natural', 'downwards', 'caught', 'helped', 'game', 'naturally', 'entire', 'everyday', 'sdg', 'looking', 'get', 'graduate', 'interview', 'box', 'big', 'water', 'traditional', 'tall', 'apply', 'development', 'adoption', 'simple', 'environmental', 'result', 'building', 'affecting', 'wall', 'noticed', 'drink', 'need', 'higher', 'easier', 'kajang', 'easily', 'ability', 'access', 'crop', 'constant', 'seed', 'explored', 'neither', 'method', 'innovation', 'engineering', 'able', 'install', 'agricultural', 'implemented', 'week', 'giving', 'machap', 'company', 'growth', 'size', 'landscaping', 'community', 'former', 'faster', 'soil', 'right', 'hong', 'connection', 'hire', 'towards', 'awareness', 'system', 'cheaper', 'evenlevel', 'gave', 'keith', 'pitch', 'growing', 'day', 'technological', 'singapore', 'greentech', 'came', 'goal', 'fellow', 'property', 'home', 'input', 'seeing', 'top', 'kee', 'grant', 'much', 'watering', 'local', 'educate', 'reach', 'bottom', 'competition', 'dug', 'stay', 'back', 'industry', 'land', 'malaysia', 'said', 'membrane', 'engineer', 'photo', 'pipe', 'president', 'level', 'governance', 'project', 'even', 'sprinkler', 'johor', 'left', 'using', 'sustainable', 'quality', 'cover', 'submit', 'altogether', 'march', 'implement', 'hole', 'optimal']",Neutral

Kota Kinabalu:

Sabah and Malaysia are not expected to be impacted drastically this year despite global economic uncertainty due to the tariff regime imposed by United States President Donald Trump. Growth rate is expected to be around 4.4 per cent.

This is due to the strength of local economic activities, said Dr Roy Choy Swee Yew, the Chief Economist of MARC Ratings Berhad at the “Economic & Market Outlook for 2025 and Beyond” session of the Sabah Renewable Energy Conference 2025 at Shangri-La Tanjung Aru Resort, recently.

“Sabah is the largest palm oil producer in Malaysia. Petroleum products and natural gas account for 50 per cent of Sabah’s total exports,” Dr Choy said.

He noted that currently, the high impact renewable energy projects in Sabah are the RM120 million Seguntor Bioenergy and the RM250 million Tadau Energy Solar Farm which is Malaysia’s first green sukuk-financed renewable energy project.

No economic crisis is seen for 2025, although the withdrawal of fuel subsidies later in the year may hike inflation temporarily for six months. Bank Negara is expected to maintain the OPR rate for this year, Dr Choy said.

On the high impact infrastructure projects in Sabah include the RM40 billion Pan Borneo Highway and the RM7.5 billion Sabah–Sarawak Link Road (SSLR), he said.

The high impact agriculture projects in Sabah include the RM33.59 million Land optimisation and Agro-Food Development and the activities under the Sabah Agricultural Blueprint 2021 – 2030.

Dr Choy acknowledged that Malaysian consumer spending has dropped, accompanied with higher external demand, as Malaysia’s manufacturing PMI declines by a margin. There is a broad-based increase in manufacturing exports.

“Domestic economic growth remains resilient despite a weaker external environment,” he said, adding that: “Malaysia’s inflation is expected to remain anchored following Trump’s tariff announcements.”

“Central banks are adopting a more dovish stance, with plans to implement further interest rate cuts,” Dr Choy revealed.

He foresees global economic growth is projected to reach 2.8 per cent in 2025, as global inflation is cooling.

“However, global trade flows and inflation dynamics remain vulnerable to U.S. tariffs. Trump’s new tariffs also target the trade imbalance with Asean,” Dr Choy said, as Malaysia chairs the organisation this year.

“Financial market uncertainties rise amid heightened trade wars. Bond market retreated following the U.S. treasuries sell off as tariff hike on pause,” he said. Malaysia is going to introduce a carbon tax by 2026.

“Markets are pricing in a dovish Federal Reserve path, likely in response to expectations of slowing inflation and recession fears. Year-to-date, our ringgit has held up well.

“Persistent foreign outflows from Malaysia’s bond and equity markets reflect waning investor confidence,” Dr Choy said.",1.74654E+12,en,0.082516827,2025-05-05 08:31:23,"['beyond', 'per', 'resort', 'later', 'regime', 'following', 'agrofood', 'asean', 'donald', 'cut', 'carbon', 'bond', 'negara', 'road', 'organisation', 'outlook', 'heightened', 'high', 'pan', 'flow', 'bank', 'berhad', 'roy', 'central', 'outflow', 'expectation', 'export', 'vulnerable', 'drastically', 'around', 'equity', 'market', 'gas', 'trade', 'include', 'sell', 'cent', 'agriculture', 'pricing', 'acknowledged', 'largest', 'uncertainty', 'expected', 'announcement', 'conference', 'going', 'energy', 'optimisation', 'plan', 'pause', 'month', 'domestic', 'chair', 'year', 'farm', 'oil', 'rating', 'hike', 'infrastructure', 'dropped', 'may', 'highway', 'held', 'malaysian', 'session', 'swee', 'advertisement', 'trump', 'kota', 'increase', 'projected', 'economic', 'crisis', 'weaker', 'also', 'temporarily', 'sabahsarawak', 'aru', 'kinabalu', 'retreated', 'recently', 'seguntor', 'inflation', 'remains', 'stance', 'path', 'ringgit', 'although', 'spending', 'margin', 'united', 'renewable', 'response', 'state', 'rise', 'fear', 'target', 'revealed', 'impact', 'strength', 'account', 'bioenergy', 'external', 'choy', 'maintain', 'well', 'investor', 'sponsored', 'green', 'natural', 'withdrawal', 'however', 'sukukfinanced', 'product', 'recession', 'resilient', 'tariff', 'confidence', 'decline', 'federal', 'financial', 'noted', 'development', 'persistent', 'demand', 'blueprint', 'opr', 'million', 'reserve', 'global', 'manufacturing', 'tax', 'adding', 'first', 'higher', 'imbalance', 'marc', 'six', 'war', 'borneo', 'cooling', 'amid', 'economist', 'dynamic', 'impacted', 'introduce', 'activity', 'petroleum', 'agricultural', 'despite', 'yew', 'dovish', 'shangrila', 'growth', 'sslr', 'accompanied', 'pmi', 'adopting', 'interest', 'remain', 'waning', 'total', 'imposed', 'reflect', 'economy', 'tanjung', 'link', 'broadbased', 'content', 'rate', 'foresees', 'foreign', 'environment', 'withstand', 'local', 'subsidy', 'sabah', 'likely', 'treasury', 'chief', 'reach', 'due', 'fuel', 'palm', 'producer', 'tadau', 'malaysia', 'president', 'said', 'project', 'land', 'slowing', 'currently', 'billion', 'seen', 'solar', 'new', 'yeartodate', 'anchored', 'consumer', 'implement']",Neutral

Jordan has strengthened its position in the global halal industry after the Directorate of Conformity Certificates at the Jordan Standards and Metrology Organization (JSMO) received official recognition from Malaysia’s Department of Islamic Development (JAKIM) for its halal certification system.In a statement issued Sunday, the Organization said the recognition followed a comprehensive evaluation process conducted by a specialized Malaysian delegation. The assessment included a visit to the Organization’s headquarters, a review of certification procedures, and inspections of several Jordanian companies holding halal certificates to ensure compliance with JAKIM’s rigorous standards.The Director General of JSMO, Abeer Al-Zuhair, noted that this achievement represents a significant step forward for Jordan, particularly in light of the expanding global demand for halal products. She added that Jordan’s recognition by JAKIM enhances the credibility of its products and opens new export opportunities to Malaysia, one of the largest halal markets worldwide.Al-Zuhair emphasized that the recognition offers a strategic opportunity to improve the competitiveness of Jordanian exports, especially as international demand for halal products continues to grow.The Malaysian delegation commended the Organization’s efforts, highlighting the Directorate’s commitment to adhering to international best practices in halal certification.The statement also noted that the Directorate had previously obtained international accreditation from the Emirates International Accreditation Centre (EIAC) in halal certification, further facilitating Jordanian products' entry into global markets with greater confidence.

By Nurunnasihah Ahmad Rashid KUALA LUMPUR, April 27 (Bernama) -- Malaysia has proposed the creation of an ASEAN Halal Council to strengthen strategic cooperation in the regional halal industry, facilitate the entry of halal products between countries, and boost intra-ASEAN trade, which has yet to reach its full potential. Halal Development Corporation (HDC) chairman Khairul Azwan Harun said Malaysia made the proposal during the Malaysia-Indonesia halal industry roundtable session in Jakarta on April 22, which was also attended by Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and the head of Indonesia’s Halal Product Assurance Organizing Agency (BPJPH) Ahmad Haikal Hassan.

“This ASEAN Halal Council will serve as a platform to streamline trade, expand markets, and harmonise the use of halal logos while also tapping into a regional market of nearly 700 million people,” he told Bernama. At the conference, both countries also proposed easing the entry of halal products by mutually recognising Malaysian and Indonesian halal certificates without additional procedures or inspections. Azwan said this initiative will not only save costs and time but is expected to boost bilateral trade between Malaysia and Indonesia, especially for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) seeking to penetrate a combined market of over 240 million Muslims.

“Malaysian products certified halal and regulated by the Department of Islamic Development Malaysia (JAKIM) can be marketed directly in Indonesia, and vice versa. This is a game changer that will immediately increase the export value of our halal products,” he said. Azwan added that Malaysia and Indonesia have also agreed to lead efforts to enhance intra-ASEAN trade, particularly for halal products, to capitalise on the regional halal market potential, currently at US$1.3 trillion (US$1 = RM4.38). “Malaysia and Indonesia play a catalytic role in this effort, as both are the largest Islamic economies in the region.",1.74578E+12,en,0.437071085,2025-04-27 08:52:28,"['lead', 'full', 'deputy', 'minister', 'haikal', 'time', 'asean', 'nearly', 'indonesian', 'entry', 'head', 'malaysiaindonesia', 'bpjph', 'inspection', 'particularly', 'intraasean', 'mutually', 'cooperation', 'recognising', 'changer', 'export', 'rashid', 'harmonise', 'yet', 'market', 'trade', 'seri', 'penetrate', 'facilitate', 'use', 'versa', 'largest', 'expected', 'organizing', 'conference', 'enhance', 'micro', 'marketed', 'lumpur', 'tapping', 'proposed', 'boost', 'value', 'halal', 'hassan', 'council', 'added', 'roundtable', 'procedure', 'trillion', 'malaysian', 'session', 'proposal', 'serve', 'enterprise', 'increase', 'vice', 'also', 'additional', 'muslim', 'harun', 'islamic', 'regulated', 'regional', 'especially', 'jakim', 'business', 'seeking', 'potential', 'medium', 'creation', 'zahid', 'combined', 'capitalise', 'datuk', 'chairman', 'platform', 'assurance', 'role', 'without', 'game', 'certificate', 'agreed', 'product', 'play', 'agency', 'ahmad', 'development', 'effort', 'region', 'cost', 'hdc', 'million', 'bernama', 'country', 'msmes', 'strengthen', 'jakarta', 'easing', 'attended', 'hamidi', 'people', 'made', 'certified', 'expand', 'azwan', 'catalytic', 'save', 'kuala', 'economy', 'directly', 'streamline', 'strategic', 'immediately', 'nurunnasihah', 'khairul', 'initiative', 'reach', 'corporation', 'indonesia', 'april', 'industry', 'department', 'malaysia', 'said', 'bilateral', 'currently', 'prime', 'logo', 'told', 'small']",Neutral

The Agriculture and Food Security Minister will be bringing his own famous headliner – Indonesian singer Hetty Koes Endang – for his ministry’s event in Serdang today.

To prevent possible criticism, Mohamad revealed in a social media post that Hetty had called him and volunteered to come to the event and serenade the audience free of charge as token of their long friendship.

Going by the comments his Facebook post has received, Mohamad’s announcement appears to have headed off any potential brickbats the ministry would have received.

“It is a good thing that Mohamad announced this early and this addresses the perception that a hefty fee was paid for her performance,” said Zamri Zainal Abidin on Facebook.

“He gave an early disclaimer (about the performance),” said another Facebook user, Akmal Roslee, while Mohamad Zalani added: “Mohamad is showing a good example.”

Others were excited at the prospect of seeing the award-winning Indonesian songstress.

“I will surely be there as Ibu Hetty is coming,” said user Nuradi Ikhwan.

Others quipped that Hetty should get the red carpet treatment on arrival.

“Please provide at least a ­driver, car, hotel and escort. Treat our guest well,” said Asril Norman.

In his original post, Mohamad talked about his friendship with Hetty and a phone call he received from the 67-year-old singer and her husband yesterday morning.

“With the utmost respect and warmth, they both told me of their desire to attend the Agriculture and Food Security Ministry’s Hari Raya Aidilfitri Open house,” Mohamad wrote.

He was also grateful that Hetty said she will volunteer to perform a few songs at the event free of charge.

“For those who don’t know, our family friendship goes back a long way. Every time I visit Jakarta, I make sure to visit her. It’s the same when she is in Kuala Lumpur. Our house is a must-visit for her.

“I extend my heartfelt appreciation to Hetty and her husband for their sincerity and willingness to add joy to the event,” Mohamad added.

The ministry’s open house will take place at the Malaysia Agriculture Expo Park (MAEPS) today beginning 11am.

The Health Ministry was recently criticised and accused of splurging on its Hari Raya Open House, an event that included singers Siti Nurhaliza and Datuk Jamal Abdillah.

Critics and doctors’ group Hartal Doktor Kontrak contrasted the lavishness of the event to the low salaries of healthcare wor­kers and paltry conditions of public hospitals and clinics.

Siti Nurhaliza then issued a statement clarifying that she had volunteered to attend and sing free of charge to show her appreciation for Health Ministry staff and medical frontliners.

President Muizzu made these remarks in a statement given before departing on an official visit to Malaysia at the invitation of Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on Sunday.

The Maldivian leader said that Malaysia and Maldives already have close relations, and he is confident that this visit would further strengthen those ties.

The president noted that Malaysia is currently the country with the highest number of Maldivians residing abroad, which is one reason why the Maldivian government is seeking to facilitate additional matters as part of the trip. He said efforts will be made towards these goals during the visit.

Highlighting the Business Forum organized by the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade as part of the trip, President Muizzu indicated that it would open up extensive opportunities in terms of networking.

In addition to this, the president mentioned that official consultations between the two governments are scheduled as part of the visit, and important matters will be addressed. He emphasized that the close relationship between the two countries would contribute to making this a successful trip.

During the visit to Malaysia, President Muizzu said he will meet with Maldivians living there to understand the issues and challenges they face, and discuss with the Malaysian government about the needs of these citizens. He also expressed hope that arrangements will be made during the trip to provide Maldivian ID card and passport services in Malaysia. The president stated that efforts will be made to further improve consular services needed by Maldivian citizens living in Malaysia and enhance services required by students.

Understanding the situation of Maldivians living abroad and identifying their interests is a matter President Muizzu gives special attention to.

The aim of the Maldivian president’s first official visit to Malaysia is to further strengthen the long-standing close relationship between the two countries. Further, as part of the trip, Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) related to cooperation in important areas are scheduled to be signed in the presence of leaders from both countries, and note exchanges are also scheduled.

Nowhere is this more evident than in Asia, a region that is both a key manufacturing base and a major consumer market.

Malaysia, in particular, is emerging as a promising hub for medical device development, underpinned by strategic policies, infrastructure and talent.

Over the next decade, Asia is expected to be at the forefront of this industry’s transformation, driven by shifting demographics, technological innovation and supportive governmental frameworks.

National and regional hubs

The global medical device industry – encompassing everything from simple syringes and rubber gloves to advanced diagnostic imaging systems and wearable health monitors – was valued at US$810bil (about RM3.5 trillion) in 2024.

Fuelled by rising health consciousness, increased healthcare spending and rapid technological advancement, the sector is undergoing significant transformation.

In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, governments, health systems and private investors have ramped up spending on diagnostic tools, telemedicine infrastructure and home-based care equipment.

Simultaneously, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT) and robotics is reimagining how devices are developed, deployed, and maintained.

Asia is no longer just a manufacturing base for Western medical device companies; it is becoming a centre of innovation, regulatory reform and domestic market expansion.

China and India, for instance, have both launched national initiatives to boost local production of medical technology, reduce import dependence and foster innovation.

China’s “Made in China 2025” policy includes high-end medical devices, while India’s Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for medical devices offers financial incentives for domestic manufacturing.

Asean nations, particularly Malaysia, are positioning themselves as strategic hubs for production, research and development (R&D), and regulatory harmonisation, leveraging a skilled workforce, favourable geography and improving infrastructure.

Malaysia’s advantages

Malaysia stands out within Asean as a particularly promising player in the medical device industry.

The country is already home to over 200 medical device manufacturers, including major global players such as Abbott, B. Braun and Boston Scientific.

In 2024, Malaysia’s medical device exports reached RM37bil, making it one of the leading exporters in the region.

The government has adopted a proactive approach in nurturing the industry.

It is one of the key sectors in the New Industrial Master Plan 2030, which aims to transform Malaysia into a high-value, innovation-driven medical device hub.

Key goals include enhancing local R&D capabilities, streamlining regulatory pathways and strengthening international partnerships.

The Medical Device Authority (MDA) plays a central role in regulating and facilitating the growth of the sector.

Its efforts to align local regulations with global standards have boosted investor confidence and export potential.

Malaysia also offers an integrated ecosystem that supports the full value chain of the medical device industry – from component manufacturing to final assembly and packaging.

The country’s experience in high-precision electronics and rubber-based manufacturing (especially gloves and catheters) provides a solid foundation for more complex device production.

In Penang, a cluster of electronics and medical technology companies are driving innovation and cross-sector collaboration.

The state’s infrastructure and talent pool have attracted increasing foreign direct investment, particularly in diagnostic and imaging equipment.

As simple as they are, even gloves are considered medical devices, playing a crucial role in hygiene and infection control. — Bloomberg

Areas of growth

As the global and regional landscape evolves, several areas are likely to define the future of the medical device industry in Asia:

> Digital health and AI-driven devices

The integration of digital technologies – including AI, machine learning and cloud computing – is transforming diagnostic and monitoring tools.

Smart wearables, remote patient monitoring systems and AI-assisted imaging are expected to dominate the next wave of innovation.

Malaysia has signalled support for digital health, with strategies to improve telemedicine, mobile health services and digital diagnostics creating pathways for medical device integration.

> Home and community-based healthcare devices

The shift from hospital-centric to patient-centric care models is creating demand for portable, user-friendly devices for home use, especially in managing chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure) and cardiovascular (heart) conditions.

This will only increase as our population ages and the need for primary, preventive care becomes all the more essential.

> Sustainable and green medical devices

Environmental concerns are pushing manufacturers to consider the life cycle of medical devices.

Recyclable materials, energy-efficient production methods and biodegradable packaging are becoming key factors, especially in export markets with stringent ESG (environmental, social and governance) expectations.

Malaysia’s National Investment Aspirations encourages sustainable practices in all manufacturing sectors, including medical technology, as part of the country’s ambition to become a regional ESG leader.

Current challenges

Despite the promise, the region – including Malaysia – faces several hurdles that must be addressed in order to realise its full potential.

These include:

Regulatory complexity While progress has been made, inconsistent regulations across Asean countries can complicate market entry and delay product approvals. The MDA is working hard with its sister entities to help standardise these.

Intellectual property (IP) protection Stronger IP frameworks are needed to attract advanced R&D investment and protect local innovation.

Talent retention Despite having a skilled workforce, brain drain and talent shortages in specialised medical technology fields can hinder progress.

Financing for startups Access to early-stage capital remains limited, particularly for indigenous medical device startups. However, this is beginning to change with the rise of regional venture capital interest in health technology.

Malaysia and its regional peers are at a critical juncture, especially as we navigate the challenges of inconsistent American trade policies.

With the right mix of policy support, international collaboration and continued investment in human capital and infrastructure, South-East Asia can transform from a production base to an innovation leader in medical devices.

For Malaysia, the decade ahead holds the promise of becoming not just a regional hub, but also a global player in shaping the future of healthcare technologies.

Success will depend on our ability to harness existing strengths while addressing systemic challenges – and in doing so, write a new chapter in the story of Asia’s ascent in the medical technology world.

Najib, imprisoned for his role in the multi-billion dollar 1MDB scandal, is pursuing a legal bid to compel authorities to confirm the existence of and execute a royal order that he said was issued last year as part of a pardon by the then-king, entitling him to serve the remainder of his sentence at home.

In a unanimous decision, a three-member Federal Court bench ruled that the Attorney-General could appeal a lower court’s January ruling in favour of Najib’s attempt to access the alleged document, with the case to be heard on July 1 and 2.

The former premier had his 12-year sentence halved last year in a pardon by then-King Al-Sultan Abdullah Ahmad Shah. Najib said an “addendum order” to the pardon that granted him home detention was ignored by authorities.

The former king’s palace has issued a letter saying the document does exist, but Malaysia’s law ministry said it has no record of it, its home minister has denied knowledge and Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has said “we did not hide anything”.

Chief statistician Datuk Seri Dr Mohd Uzir Mahidin said that the trade expansion was driven by the increase in the index of mineral fuels (+2.0%), machinery and transport equipment (+1.3%), and food (+1.0%),

“Meanwhile, Malaysia’s terms of trade edged up by 3.8% year-on-year from 115.2 points in March of the previous year,” he said in a statement on Monday.

Mohd Uzir said that Malaysia’s export prices in March 2025 were up by 0.2% to 151.8 points, from 151.4 points in the previous month.

“The export unit value index edged up by 0.2% in March 2025, as compared to the previous month.

“This increase was primarily driven by an increment in the indices of food (+1.1%), inedible crude materials (+0.9%), and machinery and transport equipment (+0.8%),” he said.

Likewise, he stated that the export volume index grew by 15.9%, in line with the increment in the indexes of machinery and transport equipment (+28.8%), manufactured goods (+15.2%), and miscellaneous manufactured articles (+7.1%).

He added that the seasonally adjusted export volume index was down by 1.0%, from 162.8 points to 161.2 points.

“Referring to the annual comparison, the unit value index and volume index went up by 1.3% and 5.4%, respectively,” he said.

Mohd Uzir said that the import unit value index registered a 0.9% decrease, from 128.1 points to 127.0 points.

“The index of mineral fuels (-2.7%), machinery and transport equipment (-0.5%) and chemicals (-0.4%) contributed to a 0.9% slip in the import unit value index in March 2025.

“However, the import volume index climbed by 7.6% in March 2025, as compared to the previous month, contributed by the increment in the index of chemicals (+17.0%), miscellaneous manufactured articles (+10.0%), and machinery and transport equipment (+8.6%),” he said.

He said that the seasonally adjusted import volume index went down by 7.3%, from 208.7 points to 193.4 points.

The analysis was based on Opensignal’s data metrics which covers not just download speeds but also consistency of network quality, as well as 4G and 5G availability.

When it comes to excellent consistent quality, Malaysia dropped four places from #58 to #62 globally between the two quarters. However, Malaysia remains within the top 10 Asia Pacific markets, ahead of Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines.

Looking at the raw values, Malaysia’s 4G/5G network availability had increased slightly from 97.7% in Q4 2024 to 97.9% in Q1 2025. However, the value for excellent consistent quality has shown slight signs of decline from 68.4% in Q4 2024 to 66.9% in Q1 2025.

With wider adoption of 5G with more consumers switching to 5G enabled plans and 5G enabled devices, the overall 5G download speed in Malaysia has declined slightly from 239.9Mbps to 237.5Mbps. However, 4G speeds have improved slightly from 29.9Mbps to 32.7Mbps.

This trend of declining 5G and improving 4G is also observed in developed markets such as Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Luxemburg, as operators are rebalancing its spectrum resource between 4G and 5G networks. As coverage remains a priority, some of these matured networks have migrated lower bands such as 700MHz and 1800MHz to 5G for wider footprint. However, these bands offer lower bandwidth. and resulted a dip in average 5G download speeds.

At the moment, all telcos in Malaysia are currently offering 5G services via Digital Nasional Berhad. After hitting 80.2% 5G population coverage in 31st December 2023, there isn’t much major progress for 5G coverage expansion. Last year, DNB’s 5G footprint only expanded slightly to 82.4% as of December 2024.

However, the Single Wholesale Network provider had focused on boosting indoor 5G reception by rolling out 5G in-building coverage solutions at airports, medical facilities and convention centers.

MIDF Research kept its target price unchanged at RM32.68, while CIMB Securities reiterated its target price of RM29.70.

According to MIDF Research, F&N’s 1HFY25 performance was within expectations, with revenue rising 2.7% year-on-year to RM2.72 billion. This was driven by broad-based domestic sales and strengthening regional exports, despite disruptions from severe flooding in East Malaysia which affected festive season sales. The group’s 2QFY25 revenue stood at RM1.33 billion, a marginal 1.4% year-on-year decline, while core PATANCI for the quarter slipped 11.8% to RM142.8 million, mainly due to start-up costs from its AgriValley dairy farm.

CIMB Securities noted that F&N’s 1HFY25 core net profit dipped 9.5% year-on-year to RM301 million, impacted by a higher effective tax rate following the expiry of tax incentives for its IndoChina operations and the imposition of withholding taxes. Despite these challenges, the results were deemed within expectations, meeting 55% of CIMB’s full-year forecast and 53% of Bloomberg’s consensus.

Both houses pointed out that margin pressures were primarily linked to the early phase investments in the integrated dairy farm in Gemas. MIDF Research highlighted that while F&B Malaysia’s operating margin softened slightly to 11.0% in 1HFY25, overall group operating margins improved to 16.0% year-on-year, aided by better product mix and favourable input costs. CIMB Securities added that while 2QFY25 EBITDA margins narrowed by 1.7 percentage points quarter-on-quarter to 17.4%, this was still a commendable level given the operational challenges.

Looking ahead, MIDF Research expressed optimism over F&N’s earnings defensiveness, underscored by stable demand for essential food and beverage products amid inflationary pressures. CIMB Securities echoed similar sentiments, expecting slight earnings moderation in the second half of FY25 due to continued dairy farm start-up losses and normalising IndoChina sales, but remained positive on F&N’s long-term prospects.

F&N’s integrated dairy farm continues to be a significant growth initiative, with the company surpassing a cattle population of 2,700 and expecting first milking by June 2025. CIMB Securities believes the venture will contribute to Malaysia’s goal of achieving 100% self-sufficiency in fresh milk production by 2030 and sees strong long-term potential despite initial start-up losses.

F&N declared an interim dividend of 30 sen per share for 1HFY25, consistent with the previous year, reflecting its commitment to shareholder returns despite a challenging operating environment.

PESHAWAR: An agriculture expert and former secretary of Pakistan Tobacco Board Khan Faraz on Tuesday asked farmers to grow hybrid maize.He said it was unfortunate that certain stakeholders in seed businesses opposed the introduction of genetically modified maize commercial cultivation.

“Maize is a cash crop and is abundantly available. It is the third most important cereal crop of the country after wheat and rice. It is the fifth biggest crop in terms of its economic value, and an average yield of maize currently hovers around four tons per hectare, which is one of the highest in the whole region,” he added. Khan Faraz recalled that progress in maize production over the years had given Pakistan a distinction in achieving one of the biggest per acre yield across South Asia apparently due to the introduction of hybrid maize seed.

He said Pakistan’s maize exports experienced a substantial surge in the past few years, which he added was better both for the country and farmers.“This growth is attributed to a bumper harvest and decreased domestic poultry feed demand, resulting in a significant exportable surplus at competitive prices.

Key export destinations include Vietnam, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka. Besides its increasing popularity as a substitute grain, maize also plays a critical role in meeting global food, feed, and industrial demands, with its market witnessing steady growth worldwide,” Khan Faraz explained.

The demand for maize, he added, has increased as a versatile ingredient in various food products, allowing maize producers to boost their agricultural produce and increase their market share.

“It merits a mention here that increasing demand for maize food, animal feed, and industrial applications is fuelled by the expanding livestock sector, rising disposable incomes, and a growing preference for processed foods. Since Pakistan, being an agricultural economy, needs to empower the farmer by providing highly efficient modern infrastructure, including warehousing, integrated technology, and a seamless supply chain. Adherence to international quality and safety standards will enhance the credibility of Pakistani maize in global markets,” the agriculture expert opined.",1.74604E+12,en,0.459035635,2025-04-29 19:00:00,"['four', 'per', 'certain', 'biggest', 'farmersthis', 'seamless', 'meeting', 'average', 'sector', 'supply', 'across', 'critical', 'tobacco', 'highly', 'secretary', 'including', 'allowing', 'integrated', 'cereal', 'maizehe', 'whole', 'cultivation', 'decreased', 'export', 'yield', 'disposable', 'around', 'market', 'genetically', 'harvest', 'surplus', 'include', 'board', 'agriculture', 'past', 'chain', 'enhance', 'besides', 'hybrid', 'domestic', 'food', 'unsplashfile', 'highest', 'year', 'infrastructure', 'grow', 'boost', 'unfortunate', 'term', 'witnessing', 'value', 'added', 'lanka', 'asia', 'international', 'increase', 'progress', 'grain', 'show', 'rice', 'economic', 'popularity', 'also', 'since', 'exportable', 'opined', 'increasing', 'substitute', 'key', 'production', 'surge', 'application', 'resulting', 'mention', 'faraz', 'stakeholder', 'business', 'one', 'recalled', 'explained', 'rising', 'significant', 'maize', 'expanding', 'credibility', 'increased', 'important', 'animal', 'providing', 'technology', 'safety', 'farmer', 'attributed', 'apparently', 'role', 'feed', 'cash', 'third', 'livestock', 'produce', 'competitive', 'pakistan', 'worldwide', 'ingredient', 'opposed', 'standard', 'product', 'ton', 'play', 'income', 'tuesday', 'region', 'substantial', 'demand', 'pakistani', 'bumper', 'global', 'need', 'price', 'poultry', 'country', 'wheat', 'merit', 'commercial', 'acre', 'introduction', 'crop', 'seed', 'khan', 'given', 'modern', 'south', 'agricultural', 'vietnam', 'processed', 'asked', 'representational', 'achieving', 'distinction', 'growth', 'abundantly', 'former', 'expert', 'modified', 'share', 'versatile', 'experienced', 'industrial', 'economy', 'empower', 'fuelled', 'efficient', 'growing', 'adherence', 'hectare', 'sri', 'available', 'due', 'various', 'malaysia', 'hovers', 'said', 'producer', 'warehousing', 'currently', 'image', 'quality', 'peshawar', 'fifth', 'destination', 'preference', 'better', 'steady']",Neutral

TAIPEI : Taiwan’s export-driven economy accelerated faster than expected in the first quarter (Q1) of 2025, official data showed today, fuelled by strong global demand for high-tech products and firms stocking up in case of higher US tariffs.

The island of 23 million people is a powerhouse in the semiconductor industry, with nearly all of the world’s most advanced chips made there.

Soaring demand for AI-related chips in recent years has fuelled Taiwan’s trade surplus with the US – and put it in the cross-hairs of US President Donald Trump and his far-reaching tariffs.

Gross domestic product expanded 5.4% on-year in Q1, the fastest pace in a year, the government’s statistics agency said in a statement, beating a Bloomberg News estimate of 3.6% and fourth-quarter growth of 2.9%.

“Demand for AI and emerging technology applications remains strong, supply bottlenecks for high-end information and communications technology (ICT) products are gradually easing, and customers are front-loading inventory in response to US tariff measures,” the statement said.

Taiwan was hit with a 32% levy on its shipments to the US on April 2 when Trump announced hefty tariffs against many US trading partners.

The tolls were suspended for 90 days after trillions of dollars were wiped off world markets, but a 10% blanket tariff remains in place.

Taiwan’s negotiating team has held talks with the Trump administration to reduce the levy.

Its trade surplus with the US is the seventh highest of any country, reaching US$73.9 billion in 2024.

Around 60% of its exports to the US are ICT products, including semiconductors.

Taiwan also exports bicycles, auto parts and machine tools.

The cabinet last week announced a planned special budget of up to NT$410 billion (US$12.8 billion) to shield the economy against the impact of the new US tariff.

London-based Capital Economics senior Asia economist Gareth Leather raised his full-year growth forecast to 5.4% from 3.9% following the latest data.

“Although Trump’s tariffs pose a downside threat to the economy, we expect growth to remain strong, helped by continued rapid growth in ICT exports,” Leather said in a note.

Taiwan had sought to avoid Trump’s threatened levy by pledging increased investment in the US, more purchases of US energy and greater defence spending.

Chips were excluded from the tariffs, but an ongoing US “national security” probe into the sector could pave the way for a levy.

However, Leather said tariffs on Taiwanese chips would not have a big impact on the island’s economy, given its dominance in the sector.

“It accounts for around 60% of global production and over 90% of the most advanced chips – importers would have little alternative to paying extra,” Leather said.",1.74604E+12,en,0.241938531,2025-04-30 09:47:15,"['onyear', 'following', 'nearly', 'hit', 'donald', 'sector', 'supply', 'rapid', 'including', 'pledging', 'inventory', 'way', 'administration', 'export', 'sought', 'tool', 'around', 'ict', 'trade', 'security', 'market', 'surplus', 'strong', 'dollar', 'machine', 'emerging', 'pose', 'expected', 'budget', 'energy', 'firm', 'bicycle', 'hefty', 'pave', 'investment', 'taipei', 'domestic', 'last', 'avoid', 'seventh', 'suspended', 'world', 'year', 'team', 'highest', 'estimate', 'toll', 'note', 'planned', 'chip', 'levy', 'soaring', 'reaching', 'taiwan', 'held', 'trillion', 'asia', 'continued', 'could', 'purchase', 'dominance', 'trump', 'senior', 'shield', 'threatened', 'expanded', 'also', 'pace', 'negotiating', 'official', 'production', 'application', 'greater', 'remains', 'special', 'shipment', 'extra', 'although', 'spending', 'exportdriven', 'probe', 'excluded', 'today', 'response', 'talk', 'latest', 'place', 'taiwanese', 'hightech', 'airelated', 'impact', 'farreaching', 'economics', 'announced', 'threat', 'account', 'increased', 'customer', 'technology', 'leather', 'beating', 'advanced', 'news', 'londonbased', 'helped', 'wiped', 'accelerated', 'forecast', 'however', 'case', 'product', 'bloomberg', 'gross', 'fastest', 'statement', 'tariff', 'agency', 'trading', 'big', 'raised', 'demand', 'alternative', 'million', 'fourthquarter', 'little', 'defence', 'capital', 'global', 'information', 'measure', 'first', 'higher', 'cabinet', 'semiconductor', 'blanket', 'crosshairs', 'country', 'downside', 'economist', 'easing', 'pic', 'given', 'expect', 'auto', 'people', 'frontloading', 'week', 'national', 'made', 'freepik', 'growth', 'island', 'would', 'remain', 'faster', 'highend', 'recent', 'stocking', 'partner', 'gareth', 'part', 'government', 'economy', 'fuelled', 'communication', 'reduce', 'fullyear', 'day', 'ongoing', 'showed', 'put', 'data', 'april', 'industry', 'powerhouse', 'president', 'said', 'many', 'billion', 'new', 'paying', 'statistic', 'quarter', 'importer', 'gradually', 'bottleneck']",Neutral

KUALA LUMPUR : Malaysia’s halal product exports rose to RM61.79 billion in 2024, a 15% increase from exports recorded the previous year, according to the investment, trade and industry ministry (Miti).

Miti deputy secretary-general (industry) Hanafi Sakri announced the figures at the soft launch of the Malaysia International Halal Showcase 2025 (Mihas) here.

“Malaysia continued to maintain its top position in the Global Islamic Economy Indicator rankings for 10 consecutive years. Malaysia’s strength lies in Islamic finance, halal food, as well as media and recreation.

“In 2024, Malaysia’s halal product exports reached RM61.79 billion, an increase of 15% from RM53.72 billion recorded in the same period of 2023,” he said.

Hanafi noted that the halal industry constituted a significant portion of Malaysia’s gross domestic product, with projections estimating its contribution will rise to 10.8%, or RM231 billion, by 2030.

“This growth is primarily driven by our robust halal ecosystem in sectors such as food and beverage, finance, and travel.”

Malaysia External Trade Development Corporation (Matrade) chairman Reezal Merican Naina Merican described the country’s target of RM1.58 trillion in exports this year as “a humble target” although he foresaw challenges ahead.

Nonetheless, Reezal said Matrade was implementing several strategies, including market diversification, particularly towards emerging markets.

“We are focusing on trading partners that currently contribute to our trade surplus. At the same time, we are also reviewing partners with whom we have a trade deficit, and exploring how we can eliminate or reduce that gap,” he said.

In March, it was reported that Matrade had been tasked with increasing the country’s export value by 5% to RM1.58 trillion in 2025.

By the end of 2024, Matrade had recorded RM1.51 trillion in export, exceeding its actual target by about RM10 billion.",1.74604E+12,en,0.40019995,2025-04-30 10:32:04,"['robust', 'deputy', 'time', 'sector', 'primarily', 'including', 'period', 'particularly', 'recreation', 'secretarygeneral', 'export', 'market', 'trade', 'tasked', 'surplus', 'projection', 'emerging', 'nonetheless', 'showcase', 'travel', 'sakri', 'lumpur', 'investment', 'domestic', 'food', 'year', 'merican', 'value', 'driven', 'halal', 'portion', 'trillion', 'international', 'increase', 'also', 'increasing', 'islamic', 'contribute', 'end', 'deficit', 'although', 'lie', 'medium', 'reached', 'ministry', 'matrade', 'rise', 'target', 'significant', 'announced', 'strength', 'diversification', 'external', 'chairman', 'challenge', 'maintain', 'well', 'position', 'soft', 'estimating', 'described', 'beverage', 'previous', 'ranking', 'actual', 'product', 'gross', 'constituted', 'trading', 'noted', 'development', 'reviewing', 'eliminate', 'figure', 'hanafi', 'global', 'bernama', 'exploring', 'implementing', 'country', 'foresaw', 'reezal', 'pic', 'rose', 'ecosystem', 'reported', 'miti', 'strategy', 'ahead', 'growth', 'finance', 'according', 'towards', 'naina', 'partner', 'kuala', 'recorded', 'economy', 'reduce', 'humble', 'top', 'focusing', 'corporation', 'gap', 'industry', 'several', 'malaysia', 'said', 'contribution', 'mihas', 'exceeding', 'indicator', 'currently', 'billion', 'launch', 'consecutive', 'march', 'continued']",Neutral

UOB Kay Hian Wealth Advisors Sdn Bhd head of investment research Sedek Jantan said the local market displayed resilience, underpinned by the influx of foreign capital and shifting sentiment.

“Notably, US president Donald Trump’s tariff 2025 announcement, which initially drove the composite index to a 20-month low of 1,400.59 on April 9, ultimately proved to be a boon in disguise.

“A sectoral symphony unfolded post-tariff, with export-oriented and consumer discretionary stocks harmonising to drive gains.

“This dynamic emerged as investors rotated into undervalued segments of the market, positioning ahead of potential trade normalisation,” he told Bernama.

Besides, he said, encouraging geopolitical developments further stabilised sentiment, with Trump’s executive order to moderate proposed auto tariffs and ongoing US-South Korea talks reportedly nearing a preliminary “agreement of understanding”.

Meanwhile, Australia’s pre-election push for tariff clarity underscored the global reverberations of US trade policy.

Sedek opined that with trade tensions potentially easing, Malaysia’s export-heavy sectors may benefit from improved prospects.

“April’s journey from sharp declines to a remarkable recovery demonstrates the market’s adaptability in the face of volatility.

“Investors will now focus on the technology and export sectors as key areas for growth in May,” he added.

The country will by 2030 strive to have at least 10 million tonnes of production capacity for non-grain resources and increase quality feed grass by more than 40 million tonnes from 2023, the agriculture ministry said late on Tuesday.

The newly launched food security campaign to cut back use of grains in the animal farming sector follows Beijing’s retaliatory tariffs on American products that have made crop purchases from the US, a top supplier, unviable. Still, the country has the world’s biggest hog herd and it’s unclear how quickly such measures can curb grain demand.

China also aims to reduce the percentage of grains used in animal feed to about 60% and of soybean meal down to about 10% by 2030, according to a document published on the website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs.

The world’s top soybean importer has for years been trying to cut its use of soybean meal in animal feed to reduce reliance on imports, especially from the US. The efforts have intensified since the trade war in US President Donald Trump’s first term but China’s soybean imports still reached a record in 2024.

China has limited purchases of other grains including corn, wheat and sorghum since last year, to bolster domestic prices and protect local farmers’ interests.

Low expressed concern over the complete removal of the RM0.10 subsidy per egg scheduled for Aug 1, warning it would increase monthly household expenses by RM15 for a family of five, based on an average consumption of one egg per person per day.

""The subsidies were introduced to cushion the impact of rising production costs following the Covid-19 pandemic and the ongoing Ukraine-Russia war, which have caused import prices for corn and soybeans to soar.

""The government's claim that production costs have stabilised is simply unreasonable, given the continuing conflict and the uncertainties posed by the United States' retaliatory tariffs,"" he said on Wednesday (April 28).

Low said the government should be transparent if it is facing fiscal challenges due to national debt, which has reached RM45.3bil as of April 30.

""Should the citizens bear the burden of repaying the government's debt?

""Where has the revenue from the Sales and Service Tax, which rose from 6% to 8%, gone?

""And what about the income from newly introduced taxes, especially when the country has been receiving billions in foreign investments?"" he questioned.

Low also raised concerns about the rapid increase in national debt and the apparent lack of solutions.

""Why has the national debt escalated so quickly, placing the burden on the public? Where are the solutions to these issues?"" he said, adding that leaders from the Pakatan coalition would also raise similar concerns and criticisms if they were in opposition today.

The Agriculture and Food Security Ministry said on Wednesday the government has agreed to end the price control on chicken eggs and reduce the egg subsidy rate from RM0.10 to RM0.05 per egg, effective May 1, 2025.

The egg subsidy will be completely abolished on Aug 1, 2025.",1.74611E+12,en,-0.597057164,2025-04-30 12:01:00,"['per', 'receiving', 'family', 'transparent', 'following', 'pakatan', 'average', 'removal', 'apparent', 'consumption', 'completely', 'rapid', 'opposition', 'stabilised', 'bear', 'unreasonable', 'import', 'say', 'quickly', 'household', 'citizen', 'conflict', 'aug', 'newly', 'security', 'monthly', 'retaliatory', 'agriculture', 'uncertainty', 'warning', 'decision', 'fiscal', 'covid', 'investment', 'facing', 'food', 'withdraw', 'debt', 'questioned', 'leader', 'may', 'complete', 'rmbil', 'expense', 'egg', 'increase', 'lawrence', 'introduced', 'also', 'soar', 'caused', 'based', 'coalition', 'escalated', 'production', 'claim', 'posed', 'especially', 'wednesday', 'end', 'corn', 'similar', 'one', 'united', 'today', 'reached', 'state', 'ministry', 'rising', 'petaling', 'control', 'datuk', 'impact', 'revenue', 'issue', 'cushion', 'criticism', 'challenge', 'person', 'gone', 'vicepresident', 'agreed', 'income', 'chicken', 'tariff', 'raise', 'mca', 'effective', 'raised', 'jaya', 'abolished', 'cost', 'simply', 'repaying', 'continuing', 'service', 'tax', 'placing', 'adding', 'price', 'country', 'war', 'soybean', 'given', 'rose', 'national', 'five', 'low', 'would', 'solution', 'concern', 'public', 'burden', 'lack', 'government', 'scheduled', 'reduce', 'ukrainerussia', 'rate', 'day', 'ongoing', 'foreign', 'subsidy', 'due', 'april', 'reconsider', 'industry', 'sale', 'said', 'expressed', 'billion', 'pandemic', 'gradually']",Negative
